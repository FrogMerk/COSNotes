Wondrous item, Uncommon

A votive candle found miraculously untouched by the
destruction of the church. When lit, it allows the bearer
to turn undead as the 2nd level Cleric ability. The
candle takes an action to light, will burn for one minute,
and requires concentration on the part of whoever holds
it.

After ten uses, the candle will have burned to the nub
and will no longer function.
