Orb, uncommon (requires attunement by a spellcaster)

This orb functions as a wand of the warmage. When its power is activated, the faces of those that it has slain can be seen swirling in the mists within the orb; their mouths wide in silent screams of eternal agony. A description of this item can be found in the Dungeon Master's Guide.

While holding this orb, you gain a +1 bonus to spell attack rolls. In addition, you ignore half cover when making a spell attack.
