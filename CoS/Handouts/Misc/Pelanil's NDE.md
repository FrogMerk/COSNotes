> You see Strahd hold out his hand and mutter some words. Your body starts tingling, all the moisture is being wicked away, and you feel yourself becoming old. The pain is agonizing. Then nothing... Then something.
>
> You find yourself floating above your body. You look down, and your crucifix is glowing. Then you remember your deity, [[Jesus|Jesus Christ of Nazareth]]. [[Jesus]] promised you you'd join him in the afterlife. Your soul must be ascending.
>
>You float eastward, out of Vallaki, along the road, through the forest, right past Castle Ravenloft itself and yet further east. Your soul makes it to the gates by which you entered Barovia just 5 days ago. You float fast them and towards the mists.
>
>You see something. There's a shadow drifting through the mist, but then it's gone. You push forward. You know that the afterlife is just beyond the fog and that you'll finally be at rest after years of battling evil.
>
>But the mists hit you like a solid wall. You cannot pass through.
>
>You clutch your cross and pray for guidance. No answer. You clutch harder and pray harder. Still no answer. You cry out for deliverance... No answer... Have you been forsaken?...
>
>The shadow. It flitters closer to you. It stands at the edge of the mists and beckons you to come. This time you can. Your soul floats through the mists and approaches the shadow. It whispers something to you. It asks a question. You nod in affirmation, swearing some unknown oath.
>
>The shadow slithers away, as the mists grow thicker, and darker until you see nothing but white... And you hear [[Father Lucian Petrovich|Father Lucian]]'s voice exclaim: "Morninglord! He's breathing".
