What shadow in the mist said when [[Pelanil]] died ([[Pelanil's NDE]]):
  
>In the veil between worlds, you stand at the precipice, Pelanil. A soul untethered, seeking life's return. Strahd sought Vampyr, yet found me, Menigal, the Departed. I offer resurrection, but it comes with a cost: to unshackle Barovia from its tyrant, to shroud it under your rule as my harbinger. Your path will be shadowed, your visage touched by the chill of death. Among the living, yet among the dead you shall be. This pact, a dual-edged gift. Choose wisely, for once bound, the pact shall weave through your very essence, entwining your fate with mine.

- After [[Pelanil]] agreed, he also explained that in order to fly under the radar, he's making him look and act like a vampire
	- [[Strahd Von Zarovich|Strahd]] will believe that [[Vampyr]] was the one responsible for [[Pelanil]]'s return
	- Only [[Vampyr]] can offer truly vampiric boons, but [[Menigal, the Departed|Menigal]] can offer his own so that they seem vampiric

**Summary**:
- [[Strahd Von Zarovich|Strahd]] came to the [[The Amber Temple (X)|Amber Temple]] to ask [[Vampyr]] to revive [[Pelanil]]
	- [[Strahd Von Zarovich|Strahd]] thought he was talking to [[Vampyr]], but he was actually talking to [[Menigal, the Departed]]
- In exchange for his life, [[Pelanil]] made a pact with [[Menigal, the Departed|Menigal]]:
	- **Destroy Strahd and Rule Barovia as [[Menigal, the Departed|Menigal]]'s Champion**
- [[Menigal, the Departed|Menigal]] can't offer truly vampiric boons
	- but he's doing what he can to make [[Pelanil]] look and act like a vampire so that [[Strahd Von Zarovich|Strahd]] doesn't get wise



**Extra loose ends**
- I'll probably explain this for the group in the session, but the [[Dark Powers]] each feed on specific types of souls
	- [[Vampyr]] collects souls who die from exsanguination (extreme blood loss)
	- [[Menigal, the Departed]]: collects those who died unnaturally (combat, magic, etc) (overlaps with [[Vampyr]])
- [[Menigal, the Departed|Menigal]] wants you to collect souls for him and eventually overthrow [[Strahd Von Zarovich|Strahd]] so that you have more soul-leverage
- I'll probably tell the group that he wants you to collect souls, but I won't tell them that your part of the pact was to overthrow [[Strahd Von Zarovich|Strahd]]
- In terms of spellcasting, [[Menigal, the Departed|Menigal]] can be your new deity
