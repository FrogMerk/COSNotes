My friends,

My apologies for letting my emotions get the best of me. I assure you, it shall not happen again. I am regretful for what I did to your cleric, and as such, I have asked a favor of a powerful friend. I expect you will see him well again soon.

Moreover, know that it is I who have brought you to this land, my home, and know that I alone can release you from it. I bid you dine at my castle so that we can meet in civilized surroundings. Your passage here will be a safe one. I await your arrival.

Your host,

Strahd von Zarovich
