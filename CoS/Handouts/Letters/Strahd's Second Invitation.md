Adventurers,

Your actions have not gone unnoticed. I extend another invitation to dine with me at Castle Ravenloft. It is time we discuss our mutual interests and the future of Barovia.

The carriage awaits your decision. If you decline, it will return empty. But be assured, our paths will cross again.
