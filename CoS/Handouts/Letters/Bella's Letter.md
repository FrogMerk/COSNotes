> Vasili, My Dear Friend,
> 
> Yes, of course I would be more than willing to help you with such a horrible problem! I can only imagine what those poor dears in Vallaki are going through. You know very well that I've had my own bad encounters with witches... encounters that have left their marks on my very soul. Children, orphaned or not, should never have to face such evil.
> 
> If you find a way to get the little ones at Andral's Orphanage safely out of Vallaki, I'll be happy to house them in my windmill. There's not much room, here, true. But we have beds and pies to go around.
> 
> Sincerely,
>
