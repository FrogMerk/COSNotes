## Locations
### Bildrath's Mercantile (E1)
> The sparse light from this building spills out from behind drawn heavy curtains. A sign over the door, creaking on its hinges, reads "Bildrath's Mercantile"
- [[Bildrath Cantemir]] owns the building
- He sells items less than 25gp from the [[CoS/Misc/RAW/Adventuring Gear]] table or 10x the price
- He has no competition in the village

### Blood of the Vine Tavern (E2)
> A single shaft of light thrusts illumination into the main square, its brightness looking like a solid pillar in the heavy fog. Above the gaping doorway, a sign hangs precariously askew, proclaiming this to be the Blood on the Vine tavern.

- Sign used to read "Blood of the Vine", but the f was scratched over
- There are a few people huddled within
	- Three [[Vistani]] sitting together (see [[#Vistani Owners]])
	- [[Arik Lorensk|Arik the Barkeep]] tending bar
	- [[Ismark Kolyanovich]] sitting by himself and sipping wine (see [[#Meeting Ismark]])
- Glass of wine costs 1cp; pitcher: 1sp
- There is only wine in this world. No beer, no mead, no liquor
- Good place to meet new PCs if necessary

#### Vistani Owners
- Remember to describe how flamboyant they are
	- Draw a line to the guy that delivered the letter
- Three [[Vistani]] Spies ([[Alenka]], [[Mirabel]], and [[Sorvia]]) sit at a table near the door
- They've been banished from the other [[Vistani]] because of something they've done to support [[Strahd Von Zarovich|Strahd]]
- They own the tavern and see that customers pay their tabs
- They show little interest in the characters
	- If they come with other [[Vistani]], they are more likely to engage in conversation and share info (see [[Vistani#Vistani Lore|Vistani Lore]])
	- If the characters seem interested, they would accept payment for info
- They tell the characters they should visit [[Madam Eva]]

#### Meeting [[Ismark Kolyanovich|Ismark]]

- He recognizes [[Lancelot]] if he's still with the group
- He's impressed if the party tells him about [[Death House]]

	- If they agree, he takes them to the [[#Burgomaster's Mansion (E4)|burgomaster's residence]]
	- He wants the characters to escort her to [[The Town of Vallaki (N)]]
		- Beyond [[Castle Ravenloft (K)]] and he hopes beyond the reach of [[Strahd Von Zarovich|Strahd]]
- He knows moving [[Ireena Kolyana|Ireena]] is a gamble
	- She's vulnerable to [[Strahd Von Zarovich|Strahd]] outside her house
 - He's heard that [[The Town of Vallaki (N)]] is well defended

### Mad Mary's Townhouse (E3)
> A moaning sob floats through the still, gray streets, coloring your thoughts with sadness. The sounds flow from a dark, two-story townhouse

- The house is boarded up and barricaded from the inside
	- DC 15 athletics check to open a door
- [[Mad Mary]] sits in the center of the floor in an upstairs bedroom clutching a malformed doll
- If inspected:
	- The doll has a strange leer and wears a sackcloth dress
	- Stitched into the hem of its dress is a frayed tag bearing the words "Is No Fun, Is No Blinsky!"

### Burgomaster's Mansion (E4)
> A weary-looking mansion squats behind a rusting iron fence. The iron gates are twisted and torn. The right gate lies cast aside, while the left swings lazily in the wind. The stuttering squeal and clang of the gate repeats with mindless precision. Weeds choke the grounds and press with menace upon the house itself. Yet, against the walls, the growth has been tramped down to create a path all about the domain. Heavy claw markings have stripped the once-beautiful finish of the walls. Great black marks tell of the fires that have assailed the mansion. Not a pane nor a shard of glass stands in any window. All the windows are barred with planks, each one marked with stains of evil omen.

- DC 11 Perception -> can discern trampled weeds all around the mansion as well as scores of wolf paw prints and human footprints
	- (the prints were made by zombies and ghouls under [[Strahd Von Zarovich|Strahd]]'s control)
 - [[Ireena Kolyana]] is inside and won't open the heavily-barred door to anyone unless she's convinced they don't have any allegiance to [[Strahd Von Zarovich|Strahd]]
	- Can convince with good roleplaying or DC 15 Deception/Persuasion
	- Or with [[Ismark Kolyanovich]]
- After entering:
	> The interior of the mansion is well furnished, yet the fixtures show signs of great wear. Noticeable oddities are the boarded-up windows and the presence of holy symbols in every room. The burgomaster is in a side drawing room on the floor -- lying in a simple wooden coffin surrounded by wilting flowers and a faint odor of decay.

- [[Ismark Kolyanovich]] and [[Ireena Kolyana|Ireena]] made the coffin themselves
- [[Ismark Kolyanovich|Ismark]] will offer 50gp to the PCs if they escort Ireena to safety
	- {Not necessarily [[The Town of Vallaki (N)]], but wherever she's safe}
	- He will suggest [[The Town of Vallaki (N)]] though

- [[Ireena Kolyana|Ireena]] refuses to go until her father is buried
	- She asks the PCs to help [[Ismark Kolyanovich|Ismark]] deliver the body to [[Donavich]]
		- No one else in town has been brave enough to help
- They warn the PCs about the church before going
	- [[Donavich]] is in a bad way recently because of his son [[Doru]]
	- Have them tell the whole story

- The next morning, [[Ismark Kolyanovich|Ismark]] accompanies the party, but [[Ireena Kolyana|Ireena]] stays home (she wants to go, but [[Ismark Kolyanovich|Ismark]] fights her on it)
 
#### [[Mad Mary]]'s Visit
- This is for if the PCs don't take the bait to visit [[Mad Mary]]
- Should happen during the day
- After the players meet [[Ireena Kolyana|Ireena]] and get situated, [[Mad Mary]] comes to the door and knocks profusely
- [[Ismark Kolyanovich|Ismark]] and [[Ireena Kolyana|Ireena]] are cautious
	- He motions to everyone to stay down and stay quiet while he answers the door
	- They've had a lot of unwelcome visitors recently
- Mary pushes her way into the house when he opens the door
	- this puts [[Ismark Kolyanovich|Ismark]] and [[Ireena Kolyana|Ireena]] at ease because it's during the day and she came in uninvited
		- They can share this with the players; maybe [[Ireena Kolyana|Ireena]] comes out of hiding when it happens and explains to the PCs while [[Ismark Kolyanovich|Ismark]] is dealing with Mary
- The players overhear Mary's frantic rambling:
	- begging [[Ismark Kolyanovich|Ismark]] to help her daughter
	- Mary speaks the first player that intervenes and begs for them to help her child
	- She rambles on about [[Gertruda]] making it sound like she's a little kid (7 or 8)
- After the PCs alleviate Mary's hysteria, [[Ismark Kolyanovich|Ismark]] walks her back home
	- In the meantime, [[Ireena Kolyana|Ireena]] explains that [[Gertruda]] is actually a teen and ran away into the mists over a week ago and is probably dead
	- There's really not much the party can do

#### A Good Time to Rest
- They're safe at the burgomaster's mansion
	- They've learned a lot, met some people, and have some story quests
- Good time for the evening to set in
- Get the Burgomaster's body to the cemetery in the morning for the funeral
- Dream pies!
	- Remind the players to try the dream pies if they haven't
	- [[Ireena Kolyana|Ireena]] and [[Ismark Kolyanovich|Ismark]] politely decline pies if offered
		- They don't know what they're made of, but have seen their addictive properties
		- They have nothing against them, but they're just not interested
		- The recommend the players just have a small portion, just in case, but see no harm
	- The players that try them are delighted by the taste
		- It's very flavorful, unexpected for food from this dreary world
		- When they sleep that night, they have bright, beautiful dreams full of color
			- They feel hopelessly safe and loved
		- They wake up more empty than usual
- Players can take watches if wanted, just in case. But nothing happens
	- They might hear footsteps encircling the house at night, then leaving
	- Players that ate pie can't be woken until morning

##### Shared Dream
- Pick a PC that's sleeping. Maybe one that ate a pie, and read the following:
>You PC find yourself standing at crossroads, where a raven beckons you towards the northern fork. You see a sign pointing that direction, but when you try to read it, you can't understand the words.
>
>Your surroundings blur, and you're delivered a camp next to a small lake that seems to be fed by a river. The camp contains 5 colorful, round tents, pitched outside four barrel-topped wagons. There's a larger tent on the shore of the lake. The camp is otherwise completely empty.
>
>You find yourself psychically drawn towards the interior of the large tent. Without consciously doing so, you start walking towards it. Inside, there sits a woman, her her face and form concealed by a dark purple cloak.
>
>She draws a card from a deck that sits atop the table. You can make out the card clearly {pull out the card} -- written atop the card are the words "The Mists".
>
>The woman speaks. "\<PC Name\>, The distance between us renders my Sight blurred and obscured. Please, join me at Tser Pool to learn what the future holds."
>
>You sleep dreamlessly for the rest of the night. You wake the next morning with a vivid memory of the dream.

- When they tell the others about their dream, they're shocked to learn they all had the same exact one
	- The woman addressed them each by name and said the same thing

### Church (E5)
> Atop a slight rise, against the roots of the pillar stone that supports [[Castle Ravenloft (K)]] stands a gray, sagging edifice of stone and wood. This church has obviously weathered the assaults of evil for centuries on end and is work and weary. A bell tower rises toward the back, and flickering light shines through holes in the shingled roof. The rafters strain feebly against their load

When approaching:
> The heavy wooden doors of the church are covered with claw marks and scarred by fire.

- Read descriptions from book for other parts of church (p 45)

#### Trap Door and Undercroft
- [[Donavich]] lost the key to the padlock on the trap door
- If the chain is removed and the trapdoor opened, the screaming stops
- The trapdoor is swollen and stuck in its frame => DC12Str to open
- [[Doru]] is in the undercroft
- Do everything you can to scare off the players; this is a hard battle
	- If they fight [[Doru]], [[Donavich]] comes down to fight the PCs
	- Have [[Donavich]] plead for them to stop as he fights
		- He'll let them go back upstairs if they stop
	- See also: [[Donavich#If Doru is Killed|If Doru is Killed]] and [[Doru#What They Want|Doru Flees for Ravenloft]]

#### Office
Contents:
- Desk drawers: few sheets of parchment, quill pens, dried-up ink jars
- Wooden cabinet: tinderbox, few wooden boxes full of candles, two well used books:
	- *The Bland of Truth: The Uses of Logic in the War Against Diabolist Heresies, as Fought by the Ulmist Inquisition* (a strange book that mixes logic exercises with lurid descriptions of fiend-worshiping cults
	- *Hymns to the Dawn* (a volume of chants to [[The Morninglord]])

#### Chapel (E5F)
- [[Doru]] hasn't been fed since he was imprisoned (over a year)
	- he cries out to his father at all hours
- [[Donavich]] prays day and night, hoping the gods will tell him how to save [[Doru]]
- If the PCs seem intent on slaying [[Doru]], [[Donavich]] does his best to stop them
	- If [[Doru]] dies, [[Donavich]] falls to the floor and weeps inconsolably, overcome with despair

#### Funeral for Burgomaster
- The PCs and [[Ismark Kolyanovich|Ismark]] come to the Church with the Body
	- They maybe set the coffin down right inside
- Meeting [[Donavich]] is strained what with all the screams
	- [[Ismark Kolyanovich|Ismark]] is able to quietly convince him to leave his praying for just enough time to conduct a funeral

### Cemetery (E6)
> A fence of wrought iron with a rusty gate encloses a rectangular plot of land behind the dilapidated church. Tightly packed gravestones shrouded by fog bear the names of souls long passed. All seems quiet.

#### Funeral for Burgomaster
- At the funeral, it's just the players, [[Ismark Kolyanovich|Ismark]] and [[Donavich]]
- [[Donavich]] offers prayers to [[The Morninglord]] in exchange for [[Kolyan Indirovich]]'s deliverance from Barovia
>_Farewell, Illuminated one, until we meet again_
>_We carry the sun in our hearts until then_
>_Give us the strength to carry on_
>_Until the next dawn_
>_We greet your ally the Moonmaiden_
>_Her silver light guides us until then_
>_There is always another dawn_
>_Farewell, precious sun._
  
- Have everyone roll perception. Highest roll:
	> While the prayer is being given, you able to spot a figure standing beyond the cemetery fence shrouded in mist. The figure is a tall man, too obscured to really see, but it appears he's wearing all black and is bowing his head as if in prayer.

- After the funeral, the man is gone; You don't know where he went
- Once buried, [[Donavich]] suggests the [[Ireena Kolyana|Ireena]] be taken as far from [[Castle Ravenloft (K)]] as possible
	- He proposes the PCs take her to the [[Village of Krezk (S)#Abbey of Saint Markovia|Abbey of Saint Markovia in Krezk]], or failing that, the fortified town of [[The Town of Vallaki (N)]]
		- {He doesn't know that the Abbey is evil now}
		- ([[The Town of Vallaki (N)]] is on the way to [[Village of Krezk (S)]] and [[Ireena Kolyana|Ireena]] or [[Ismark Kolyanovich|Ismark]] may convince them to go there anyway)

## After the Funeral
- With the Burgomaster buried, [[Ireena Kolyana|Ireena]] is ready to head to [[The Town of Vallaki (N)]]
- The players may want to rest another night (esp if they fought [[Doru]])
	- But [[Ismark Kolyanovich|Ismark]] and [[Ireena Kolyana|Ireena]] {rightly} are pretty heavily against this
	- [[Strahd Von Zarovich|Strahd]] no longer has a reason to let up his pursuit of [[Ireena Kolyana|Ireena]] since [[Kolyan Indirovich]] is buried
	- If they want to rest, [[Ismark Kolyanovich|Ismark]] recommends they can make it to [[Tser Pool Encampment (G)|Tser Pool]] before nightfall
		- for a safe place to camp
		- [[Ismark Kolyanovich|Ismark]] says the [[Vistani]] tribe at that location are friendly to visitors
			- unlike the evil women at the tavern
		- {if they've talked to [[Vistani]], remind them they said to visit [[Madam Eva]] there}
- If they're weak, don't throw in any encounters
	- If they haven't fought any in town, make sure they get some
 - Level up the characters when the rest next
 - Ismark offers to take care of [[Lancelot]] because:
>The road is no place for a house-raised animal

## Events (p 48)
### Dream Pies ([source](https://www.reddit.com/r/CurseofStrahd/comments/8xu9lo/fleshing_out_curse_of_strahd_the_village_of/))

[[Mechanics of Dream Pastries]]
- Run this event when the players first leave Death House
- Read:
	> You hear the sound of small, wooden wheels rolling across damp cobbles. You trace the lonely sound to a hunched figure huddled in rags, pushing a rickety wooden cart through the fog. The figure approaches the door of a nearby home and knocks
- if approaching:
	> You catch a delicious smell on the air. You see that the figure is an old lady. She's just handed something to the person in the house, and he is thanking her profusely
- The players meet [[Morgantha]] selling her dream pastries
	- She's in the guise of an old woman and has come from [[Old Bonegrinder (O)]] to sell her pastries
- She has a small variety of pies (they don't have to be meat. Just contain kid parts like ground up bones)
	- Meat pies, maple nut pies, and a hearty pie with a potato base
	- if asked the type of meat:
		> Oh, Barovians use all kinds of meat. Especially since we've a dreadful lack of sunlight for good fruits and veggies. I myself prefer chicken, but there's also goat, deer, pig, and wolf meat depending on where you go. You'd think wolf meat would be more of delicacy, huh? Not here, dearie! With Lord Strahd in charge there's more wolves in these woods than we know what to do with!
- The pastries normally cost 1gp each
	- but she will gift the party a pie to share for dinner (she won't take no for an answer)
		- She waves the fee because they're new to Barovia and their journey into town must have been hard
- When she explains why they're so expensive:
	- it's a bit of magic her mother taught her before the witch killed her
	- The pies bring the eaters only the sweetest of dreams, something poorly lacking in this dreary world (make her seem grief stricken by the state of the world)
- She'll point them to the [[Village of Barovia (E)#Blood of the Vine Tavern (E2)|Blood on the Vine Tavern]], seeing how tired they seem to be after having just escaped [[Death House]]
