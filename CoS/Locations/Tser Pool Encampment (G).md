## Locations
### Entering the Camp
- Draw a stark contrast between what they've seen so far ([[Death House]] and [[Village of Barovia (E)]])
	- These people are colorful and having fun singing and drinking around the fire
- When the party enters, as soon as a [[Vistani|Vistana]] catches sight, have them call out like they've just seen a long lost friend
	- The party is ushered in around the fire and given food and wine
- One or two of the [[Vistani]] should be the main NPCs in the camp
	- [[Arahja]] doing most of the talking and [[Rina]] chiming in every now and then
- There are 12 bandits that are drinking and 3 sober bandit captains

### Questions for and from the Group
- At the campfire [[Arahja]] may ask the group:
	- [ ] where they're from
	- [ ] where they're headed
	- [ ] how they ended up here
	- [ ] what they thought of [[Village of Barovia (E)|Barovia Village]]
	- [ ] what are their goals
		- like beyond just rescuing [[Ireena Kolyana|Ireena]]
		- do they want out
		- what would they do if they left Barovia
	- [ ] what's their backstory
- The group may ask about
	- [[Strahd Von Zarovich|Strahd]] or the land:
		- [[Vistani#Vistani Lore|Vistani Lore]]
	- The story of [[Vistani#The Vistani and Strahd Von Zarovich Strahd|The Vistani and Strahd]]:
		- They're happy to tell about how their understanding with [[Strahd Von Zarovich|Strahd]] came to pass ([[Vistani#The Vistani and Strahd Von Zarovich Strahd|The Vistani and Strahd]])
	- [[Village of Barovia (E)#Vistani Owners|The Vistani from the Blood on the Vine Tavern]]:
		- When mentioned, the Vistani at the fire spit on the ground and swear "Mortu!"
		- They advise the party to stay away from filth like that
	- {Don't mention the name of the windmill}

#### Trapped in Barovia
- One way or another, work this into conversation
	- Maybe make a passing joke:
 
>Look at this one, Rina! His skin is so tan! Almost like Vistani, himself, eh?
>Yes, show it off while you can, Giorgio. The coming years without sunlight are sure to steal it from you.

- When the players ask why, the Vistani somberly tell them that no one leaves Barovia
	- Once in the mists, you're here forever "So welcome to your new home"
- When the players ask how they might escape this land
	- The Vistani don't know, but recommend talking to [[Madam Eva]]
		- If there's any chance of escape, she'd know it

#### A Vistana's Tale
- if the characters hang around long enough:
>A mighty wizard came to this land over a year ago. I remember him like it was yesterday. He stood exactly where you're standing. A very charismatic man, he was. He thought he could rally the people of Barovia against the devil Strahd. He stirred them with thoughts of revolt and bore them to the castle en masse.
>
>When the vampire appeared, the wizard's peasant army fled in terror. A few stood their ground and were never seen again.
>
>The wizard and the vampire cast spells at each other. Their battle flew from the courtyards of Ravenloft to a precipice overlooking the falls. I saw the battle with my own eyes. Thunder shook the mountainside, and great rocks tumbled down upon the wizard, yet by his magic he survived. Lightning from the heavens struck the wizard, and again he stood his ground. But when the devil Strahd fell upon him, the wizard's magic couldn't save him. I saw him thrown a thousand feet to his death. I climbed down to the river to search for the wizard's body, to see if, you know, he had anything of value, but the River Ivlis had already spirited him away.

- The storyteller doesn't remember the wizard's name, but recalls that it sounded important {[[Mad Mage of Mount Baratok]]}

### [[Madam Eva]]'s Tent
- She calls for them to enter as approach the tent, and before they announce themselves
- She addresses them all by name without introduction
>I've been awaiting your arrival. I see that fate has indeed led you to me. Are you ready to learn your fate?

- If pressed:
>My cards grant me sight into the Threads of Fate that bind us all. They told me that champions were coming to the land and that I would guide them on their path.

#### [[Card Reading]]
>Madam Eva clears the table in the middle of the room. She takes out a roll of black velvet from a chest nearby and carefully rolls it out on the table. From the chest she also pulls a crystal ball, and a deck of cards. You've all seen these cards before in your dream. She then cuts the cards into two separate decks and says "this is the high deck and this is the common deck". She begins to draw from the top, laying the cards in a cross shape in the middle of the table.   

- Take down the DM screen
- Perform the actions as you say them
- Have her character wait for silence before reading the next card
- After the reading, she shoos the party out of the ten to go have fun
