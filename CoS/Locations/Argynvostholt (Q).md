## Spiders Hidden
- hidden in thick webs
- even during battle, some may come out later
- call for perceptions against stealth

## Living Fire
- After one or both of the first floor battles:
- in one of the fireplaces, or the stove:
>The fireplace (or oven or whatever) is completely soot choked and clogged with piles of ash. However, though the fireplace is obviously long abandoned and shows no recent signs of use, there's a single ember struggling for life among the ash.

- Upon closer inspection, players can see that:
>the ember sluggishly pulls bits of ash towards itself, as if it knows it won't survive much longer but is unwilling to give up.

- If players try to put out the ember, maybe by smacking it or scooping some ash on top of it
	- the ember seems to panic and roll around in a desperate attempt to escape
	- It crawls away from the players
- play it sad like calcifer from Howl's Moving Castle
	- try to get the players to help it out with tinder, wood, cloth, etc.


**- Once given some fuel:**
>the ember busts to life, growing furiously and assumes the shape of a small dragon with wings made of smoke. The flaming figure glows a peculiar white-blue and feels cool instead of hot.

- This is Argynvost's ghost, though it still hasn't gained enough strength to talk. The dragon suddenly takes off, soaring past the players in a flurry of cold air and choking smoke.
- Players can easily follow the ghost's scorched path upstairs, where it ends in area Q33.


**Chat with Argynvostholt**
- He's waiting on the third floor near the collapsed ceiling (Q33)
>You see the same dragon from before, though he's not quite as small as he was. The huge ethereal form sits upon the pile of rubble, dusting the debris beneath him with frost from his imposing dragon body. He's staring into the room across from him with the wall broken in

- He's looking at the back of the throne (facing the window) where Vladimir sits (the players can't see him there)

- when they approach, even stealthily, he says "Hushhh. We must speak, but not here. Come, my dear guests."
	- he floats through the large doors into Q40


## The Beacon
- tomb is not in the graveyard, but bones are laid to rest in the tower with the beacon
- entering the tower (Q50, Q51):
>Inside this tower, you see an enormous skeleton laid carefully around the tower with obvious reverence, a sky-high grave.

- Investigation or nature:
>Noticeably missing from this skeleton is a skull.

- The grave has been desecrated
	- this is why the nights have turned evil

## Chat with Argynvost
[[Argynvost]]
- "This... was my Order. A brotherhood of the valorous.... And we battled corruption. We could not have known we would fail."
- "We are dead and yet we live, macabre profanities of nature, only slightly better than Strahd himself."
- "My knights can no longer hear me. But I can hear them. Their hatred burns like a brand against what is left of my soul."


### Vlad in Q36
[[Vladimir Horngaard]]
- don't tell them he's there immediately
	- when they walk into the room, read the part about his corpse
- he's sitting hunched over a really pretty sword (+2 greatsword) while sitting on the throne
- don't move him until it's time!
- when the reach for his sword:
>"A corpse...", he grumbles, "Should be left well alone."

- fight doesn't have to break out
	- the players can lie and agree with him
	- or if they don't seem serious in their opposition:
		- "It matters little. The years will pass and you will see the truth as I have seen it."
	- if the players sound genuine about and capable of killing [[Strahd Von Zarovich|Strahd]], he'll fight them
	- don't hold back in a fight with him and the phantoms
		- if the whole party dies, [[Sir Godfrey Gwilym]] can nurse them back in the barracks 
	- he won't purse too far if they run

### Godfrey
[[Sir Godfrey Gwilym]]
- May revive the players when they get downed
- has a ton of info
- must meet him after the others
- he can show them around the castle without provoking fights
- If asked about the beacon, he says "let me show you something" and takes them to the tower
- the bones were taken to [[Castle Ravenloft (K)|Ravenloft]] initially
	- [[Sir Godfrey Gwilym|Godfrey]] and [[Vladimir Horngaard|Vlad]] brought them back one by one every day for nearly a year
	- The witches at [[Ruins of Berez (U)|Berez]] stole the skull after an attack on the castle
- The revenants went mad after the skull was taken
	- [[Sir Godfrey Gwilym|Godfrey]] is sure that the evil affected them after the tomb was desecrated

### The Beacon (Q53)
>Laid around this landing are bones. You estimate at least 500 bones forming an enormous skeleton. They seem to have been laid here deliberately, painstakingly, and with utmost reverence. Notably missing from this huge dragon skeleton is the skull.

- This skeleton is even bigger than the spectral form of [[Argynvost]] they we already encountered
