## The Timeline
- **10 Years Ago**
    - The first gem was stolen and never seen again.
- **A Month or so Ago**
    - The forest folk started acting strangely in the woods. [[The Keepers of the Feather|The Martikovs]] started hearing strange stories that they were gathering at [[Yester Hill (Y)|Yester Hill]] for some unknown cause.
    - While [[The Keepers of the Feather|The Martikovs]] of course used their ravens to collect this information, they won't openly tell the players their information gathering methods. Instead, they'll either be vague or lie, saying they heard the news from hunters from Kresk.
- **Three Weeks Ago**
    - The second gem was stolen in the night. There was no great fight or witnesses. However, the Martikovs were able to trace tracks to Berez but haven't dared actually venture into the bogs. They all know it's quite dangerous there.
- **One Week Ago**
    - The [[Forest Folk]] and their blights attacked the winery. The Martikovs were able to defend their home for a time. Remember, they're wereravens and are actually pretty good in combat.
- **Five Days Ago**
    - Two days into the assault, the Forest Folk found and stole the third and final gem.
- **Two Days Ago**
    - The blights were finally too much for the family to fend off and they had to flee the winery. They've been living in the woods since, trying to figure out a way to win back their home.

## The Martikovs
- [[Davian Martikov|Davian]]: Family Patriarch
- [[Adrian Martikov]]: Oldest son

	 - Children:
		 - [[Claudiu Martikov]]
		 - [[Martin Martikov]]
		 - [[Viggo Martikov]]
		 - [[Yolanda Martikov]]

## Forest Folk
- Some of [[Forest Folk]] were actually once friendly with [[The Keepers of the Feather|The Martikovs]]
- The then Krezkov, now ([[The Keepers of the Feather|Martikov]]), family gave them shelter from [[Strahd Von Zarovich|Strahd]] 
	- It was these friendly [[Forest Folk]] who gave [[The Keepers of the Feather|The Martikovs]] the gift of [[Lycanthropy]] before they were wiped out


## Areas
### W9
- use 3 [[Twig Blight Swarm Statblock]], each containing about 8 twig blights
- use [[Druid Assailant Statblock]]

### W14. Wine Cellar
- In the winery's heyday, the wine cellar was packed with barrels awaiting shipment, but those days are long gone.

>Wooden pillars and beams support the ten-foot-high ceiling of this ice-cold cellar, which is split in two by a five-foot-thick brick wall. A thin mist covers the floor. Each half of the cellar features an eight-foot tall wooden partition that doubles as a wine rack. The western rack stands empty, but the eastern one is half filled with wine bottles.

- Unless they have been drawn outside, five needle blights and one druid (NE male human) lurk in the eastern portion of the cellar. If they are here when the characters enter that part of the cellar, read:

>Something moves behind the eastern wine rack. Through the holes, you glimpse a half dozen humanoid figures, one with a full rack of antlers. You hear a gravelly voice mutter the words of a spell.

- On his first turn, from behind the wine rack, the druid casts a thunderwave spell, which shatters 1d20+10 of the wine bottles as it resounds throughout the cellar. The druid then orders the needle blights to attack.

- The cellar gets markedly colder the closer one gets to the north wall. Against that wall in the eastern portion of the cellar rest three frosty barrels containing Purple Grapemash No. 3, a fact that is emblazoned on each barrel's side. A single bottle of Purple Grapemash No. 3 lies on the flagstone floor in the western half of the cellar.

- The wine rack in the eastern half of the cellar holds forty bottles, the labels of which show that the wine is the winery's Red Dragon Crush.

- A secret door between the two halves of the wine cellar can be pushed open to reveal a freezing cold passageway (area W15).

>You notice that the nearer you are to the back of the cellar, the colder it feels

- DC 15 perception to find the secret door

#### Blinsky
- [[Piccolo]] jumps out at whoever enters and attacks their face
- When [[Gadof Blinsky|Blinsky]] realizes who it is, he calls off [[Piccolo]]
	- his story:
		- he was being attacked by vampires in [[The Town of Vallaki (N)|Vallaki]], but [[Piccolo]] distracted them by jumping on their faces
		- That gave [[Gadof Blinsky|Blinsky]] enough time to run and hide
		- He snuck from alley to alley until he was able to make a break for the woods
		- [[Piccolo]] found him in the woods and they camped there for a night
		- but they woke up to find themselves surrounded by [[Forest Folk]]
