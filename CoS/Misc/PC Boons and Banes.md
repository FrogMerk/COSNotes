Upcoming ([[Menigal, the Departed|Menigal]])
**BOON:**

- [x] Character gains Among the Dead from the Undying Warlock class
    
- Character automatically succeeds death rolls
    
- Character has advantage with attacks against humanoids with 25% or less health and if the attack would result in 3 hit points or less, the target is reduced to 0 hit points instead.
    

**BANE:**

- Daily DC 14 wisdom saving throw. On a failure:
    
    - The DM may choose that 1 attempt that day to aid/heal someone who was injured unnaturally will instead result in additional damage as Menigal intervenes to end their life instead of saving it.
        
    - The DM may choose that 1 attempt that day to attack an enemy is instead redirected to another target, including a party member, if the damage from that attack will result in that alternative target being brought to 0 or less hit points.
        
    - The DM may cause the character to force fail a Suggestion spell from Menigal, ordering the character to spare a humanoids life.
