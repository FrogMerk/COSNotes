- Secret society of wereravens that opposes [[Strahd Von Zarovich|Strahd]]
- They have an extensive spy network and are able to keep tabs on [[Strahd Von Zarovich|Strahd]]'s minions

## When to Reveal the Secret
- Try to save the secret of the wereravens for as long as possible in the campaign
	- The Keepers of the Feather are a very secretive group and they won't trust someone willy nilly.
	- What's more, your players are _not_ the first heroes they've seen who've come to take down Strahd.
	- The Keepers won't present themselves without good reason.
- There should really only be two reasons a wereraven reveals themselves to the party throughout the campaign.
	1. The wereraven is cornered in combat and has to use their abilities to survive, even if the PCs see them.
	2. The party does something so profoundly helpful or otherwise ingratiate the Keepers to them that the wereravens reveal themselves out of honor.
