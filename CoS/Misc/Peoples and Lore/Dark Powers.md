- They hunger for souls
	- they can get them themselves, but it takes a lot of work because they can't live in mortal realms
	- so they recruit champions to do it
- each one can only eat a certain type of soul
	- [[Vampyr]]: collects souls who die from exsanguination (extreme blood loss)
	-  _Fekre, Queen of Poxes_: collects the souls of those who die from her pox
	- _Delban, Star of Ice and Hate_: collects souls who freeze to death
	- [[Menigal, the Departed]]: collects those who died unnaturally (combat, magic, etc) (overlaps with [[Vampyr]])
- This is why there are soulless in the valley
	- there used to be a bunch of souls, but slowly, [[Vampyr]] has sucked them dry
	- the mists prevent new souls from entering
- When [[Shar]] created the [[Shadowfell]], the [[Demiplane of Dread]] fragmented, and each Darklord's (e.g. [[Strahd Von Zarovich|Strahd]]) realm settled into a spot somewhere within the newly created plane
	- these realms are the [[Domains of Dread]]
- The Dark Powers move between these domains by their misty borders or through each of the identical [[The Amber Temple (X)|Amber Temple]]s in each of the [[Dread Planes]] (see [reddit post](https://www.reddit.com/r/CurseofStrahd/comments/cgsh14/what_are_the_dark_powers/))
	- this is how [[Rictavio]] travels between planes and how he got to Barovia in the first place

The **Dark Powers** are the manifestation of evil in [Barovia Valley](https://spinachdip.obsidianportal.com/wikis/barovia-valley). They are responsible for the imprisonment of this land in this evil plane of existence, the corruption of [Mother Night](https://spinachdip.obsidianportal.com/wikis/mother-night) and banishment of the [Morninglord](https://spinachdip.obsidianportal.com/wikis/morninglord), and for the granting of many temporary or permanent evil boons to their followers such as the vampirism of [Count Strahd von Zarovich](https://spinachdip.obsidianportal.com/characters/strahd), the lichdom of [Khazan](https://spinachdip.obsidianportal.com/characters/khazan), the magical powers of [Baba Lysaga](https://spinachdip.obsidianportal.com/characters/lysaga), and the monstrous arm of [Izek Strazni](https://spinachdip.obsidianportal.com/characters/izek).

It is said they were originally hidden away in sarcophagi in a hidden temple under [Mount Ghakis](https://spinachdip.obsidianportal.com/wikis/mount-ghakis) known as the [Amber Temple](https://spinachdip.obsidianportal.com/wikis/amber-temple), until the wizards tasked with protecting them were taken under their evil influence, and some have since been destroyed. They are led by a secretive evil deity from another world known as Vecna, who, along with the three oldest powerful Dark Powers of Vampyr, Tenebrous, and Zhudun, require sacrificial pacts for access to their dark abilities. However, each dark ability comes with a consequence of equal value.
