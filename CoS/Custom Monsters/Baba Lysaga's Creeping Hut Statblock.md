      An animated object doesn't require air, food, drink, or sleep.

  - name: Antimagic Susceptibility
    desc: The hut is incapacitated while the magic gem that animates it is in the
      area of an antimagic field. If targeted by dispel magic, the hut must
      succeed on a Constitution saving throw against the caster's spell save DC
      or fall unconscious for 1 minute.
