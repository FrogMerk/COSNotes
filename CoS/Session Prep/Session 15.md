## Things To Resolve
- The wolf hunters will come back in the evening with [[Carlos]] and will be expecting the rest of their payment
	- They also have news of [[Ismark Kolyanovich|Ismark]] in [[Village of Barovia (E)|Barovia Village]], a letter to [[Ireena Kolyana|Ireena]]
- [[Izek Strazni|Izek]] needs to tell [[Elora]] about their childhood
	- he may say they need to go meet [[Vargas Vallakovich|Vargas]]
- [[Ireena Kolyana|Ireena]] has left some items with [[Ms Belasco|Dr Velasco]] or [[Danika Dorakova|Danika Martikov]] because she had a bad feeling of what might happen to her
	- needlepoint she'd done for each of the PCs:
		- a cross for [[Pelanil]]
		- a rock donkey for [[Bardolf]]
		- a butt flute for [[Shalooti]]
		- a pride flag for [[Anakir]] (she must have made it right after the toy store)
		- [[Elora]]'s is the most striking, showing obvious skill. She must have worked for hours on this
			- It's a detailed portrait of [[Elora]], tail included, and even prominent. And in this depiction, the tail is very ornate and quite beautiful.
			- When handed the cross-stitch, you see there is a note on the back:
				- "Never be ashamed of who you are"
	- [[Danika Dorakova|Danika]] and [[Urwin Martikov|Urwin]] emphasize to the party that [[Ireena Kolyana|Ireena]] is likely lost, and if they wish to save her, they need more power and/or allies
		- Maybe they come out as [[The Keepers of the Feather|The Order]]
			- If the party questions their advice, they can take them to the secret room upstairs and tell convince them they're right because of all the spies and intel they have
		- They can also tell them that the [[Mad Mage of Mount Baratok|Mad Mage]] is probably who they're looking for
- After the Feast, the town is on high alert
	- put a session or two in between the feast and the festival

[[Ismark's Letter]]

>My dearest sister, life has become more difficult these days since your leaving. With father's death now publicly known, I've stepped up to fill the role of Burgomaster. But the villagers reject me. They refuse to be led by "The Lesser".
>
>I know that you would have been a better leader, Ireena. I just wish I had your political prowess. 
>
>Since yesterday, there seems to have been an outbreak of some new disease. More than half the town have taken to shuffling through the streets like the undead. They all sweat profusely and seem to shake uncontrollably. I've even seen some fall in the streets with seizures. Paranoia and confusion reign. Please send advice.
>
> Yours, Ismark


## Strahd's Monologue
- He starts with the bones
- He says what he needs to
- He takes off with [[Ireena Kolyana|Ireena]]

## Vallaki is Burning
- Play the mini game
- destroy some of the buildings and kill some of the NPCs

## The Blue Water Inn
### The Martikovs
- The blue water inn is still standing, and [[Urwin Martikov|Urwin]] tells the party to come rest
	- he swears they'll be safe
- [[Danika Dorakova|Danika]] gives the party the gifts [[Ireena Kolyana|Ireena]] left for them
- Once in the inn, the Martikovs will tell the party
	- [[Ireena Kolyana|Ireena]] is likely a lost cause - [[Strahd Von Zarovich|Strahd]] will surely turn her
		- If they are to have any hope, they must gather allies and grow their power
		- They know about the [[Mad Mage of Mount Baratok|Mad Mage]]
			- He can sometimes be spotted on [[Lake Zarovich (L)|Lake Zarovich]] at the base of [[Mount Baratok (M)|Mount Baratok]]
		- If the party questions their knowledge, they'll take them upstairs and come out as [[The Keepers of the Feather|The Order]]
	- She left something for the party
	- They recommend the party stays in town and regains their strength, and maybe attend the festival
		- They fear the worst, and they think the party could help provide some safety to the townsfolk
	- If the party needs guidance on where to go, they recommend tracking down the [[Mad Mage of Mount Baratok|Mad Mage]]

### Izek
- Tells [[Elora]] he about their childhood
	- [[Death House]] family descendants; the evil they did was passed down through family lines as these deformities
	- He was bullied and his life was threatened, so their family fled to end up being attacked by wolves outside of town
	- He's had dreams of [[Elora]] and she ages like normal
- [[Izek Strazni|Izek]] is not as violent as everyone thinks he is; he just has to keep up appearances
	- He's always kind of doubted [[Vargas Vallakovich|Vargas]]'s beliefs, but he owed the man for saving him
- He recommends the party meet [[Vargas Vallakovich|The Burgomaster]]

### Carlos
- The hunters bring back [[Carlos]] and expect payment
- They leave [[Ismark's Letter]]
