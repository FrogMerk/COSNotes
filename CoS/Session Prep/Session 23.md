## The Mist
- [[Shalooti]]'s strength check (15) fails (it's harder than medium)
	- both [[Elora]] and [[Shalooti]] are being dragged
	- she and [[Elora]] can make a dex save to let go in time
	- if they're able to pull him out, use time dilation to let him talk to [[Menigal, the Departed]]
 
- Explain what the dark powers are:
	- show the picture
 
>You have returned to me, but you have not yet completed your side of our bargain.

- [[Pelanil]] doesn't remember:
	- "let me refresh your memory"

>I am [[Menigal, the Departed]], one of the [[Dark Powers]] that coalesce in the [[Domains of Dread]]. You see, when [[Shar]] created the [[Shadowfell]], the [[Demiplane of Dread]] fragmented, and each Darklord's realm settled into a spot somewhere within the newly created plane. Barovia, ruled by [[Strahd Von Zarovich|Count Strahd von Zarovich]], has settled here.
>
>For too long, [[Vampyr]] has had his way with this realm, emptying this forsaken land of souls and taking them for himself. I intend to change that.
>
>We [[Dark Powers|Powers]] feed on souls of the mortal. Each of us have particular souls that satiate us. [[Vampyr]] consumes souls who perish from exsanguination (blood loss). And I, you see, have a more general, but overlapping craving. I desire souls that die of any _unnatural_ cause.
>
>So this is why I require your assistance. I want to deny [[Vampyr]] his souls, and instead take them for myself.

>And our pact, you surely remember our pact.

	- send Christian https://cos.nathanorick.com/no-spoilers/campaign-notes/handouts/misc/pelanil's-conversation-with-menigal.html
- while he reads that, cut to the other players if they lost him

After he has a chance to read:
- Give [[Pelanil]] a new boon
	- Character gains [[Among the Dead]] from the Undying Warlock class

>And for dispatching to me the soul of that insufferable toymaker, I offer you this


## Kavan's Spear for Shalooti
- wisdom save to hear the voice
- [[Yester Hill (Y)#Blood Spear of Kavan]]



## Yester Hill
- [[Yester Hill (Y)]]
- They can explore, see the fog, climb the mountain
- at the right time (maybe after they've seen the [[Strahd Von Zarovich|Strahd]] statue), the bois start coming out of the rock towers and doing the ritual
- When [[Wintersplinter Statblock]] comes to life, the druids and berserkers flee for the tree line, taking opportunity attacks
- After the battle, the remaining forest folk flee for the woods
	- their effigy dying is a bad omen, and they kinda start to doubt [[Strahd Von Zarovich|Strahd]]'s power
