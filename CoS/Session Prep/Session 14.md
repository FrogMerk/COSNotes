## Things To Resolve
- Everyone rolls initiative to start
	- the vamps run away, [[Elora]] gets an opportunity attack
- The wolf hunters will come back in the evening with [[Carlos]] and will be expecting the rest of their payment
	- They also have news of [[Ismark Kolyanovich|Ismark]] in [[Village of Barovia (E)|Barovia Village]], a letter to [[Ireena Kolyana|Ireena]]
- [[Fiona Wachter|Fiona]] needs to tell [[Anakir]] more about her "followers" and ask him to help with her plans to overthrow [[Vargas Vallakovich|The Burgomaster]]
- Run [[Elora]] through the middle of town so [[Izek Strazni|Izek]] can react to her
- [[Ireena Kolyana|Ireena]] has left some items with [[Ms Belasco|Dr Velasco]] or [[Danika Dorakova|Danika Martikov]] because she had a bad feeling of what might happen to her
	- needlepoint she'd done for each of the PCs:
		- a cross for [[Pelanil]]
		- a rock donkey for [[Bardolf]]
		- a butt flute for [[Shalooti]]
		- a pride flag for [[Anakir]] (she must have made it right after the toy store)
		- [[Elora]]'s is the most striking, showing obvious skill. She must have worked for hours on this
			- It's a detailed portrait of [[Elora]], tail included, and even prominent. And in this depiction, the tail is very ornate and quite beautiful.
			- When handed the cross-stitch, you see there is a note on the back:
				- "Never be ashamed of who you are"
	- [[Danika Dorakova|Danika]] and [[Urwin Martikov|Urwin]] emphasize to the party that [[Ireena Kolyana|Ireena]] is likely lost, and if they wish to save her, they need more power and/or allies
		- Maybe they come out as [[The Keepers of the Feather|The Order]]
			- If the party questions their advice, they can take them to the secret room upstairs and tell convince them they're right because of all the spies and intel they have
- After the Feast, the town is on high alert
	- put a session or two in between the feast and the festival

[[Ismark's Letter]]

>My dearest sister, life has become more difficult these days since your leaving. With father's death now publicly known, I've stepped up to fill the role of Burgomaster. But the villagers reject me. They refuse to be led by "The Lesser".
>
>I know that you would have been a better leader, Ireena. I just wish I had your political prowess. 
>
>Since yesterday, there seems to have been an outbreak of some new disease. More than half the town have taken to shuffling through the streets like the undead. They all sweat profusely and seem to shake uncontrollably. I've even seen some fall in the streets with seizures. Paranoia and confusion reign. Please send advice.
>
> Yours, Ismark

- People are still recognizing [[Elora]]

## Wachterhaus
- [[The Town of Vallaki (N)#Wachterhaus (N4)]]
- [[Fiona Wachter|Fiona]] finishes her conversation with [[Anakir]] and invites him back with his friends for dinner
	- She has a favor to ask
- Eventually, someone (a cult member) runs in and tells her that her sons are alive thanks to her messiahs
	- "the prophesy is being fulfilled! Look out the window! The sky is getting brighter!"
	- [[Anakir]] may want to finally leave at this point

## Fight at the Gallows
- [[Izek Strazni|Izek]] sees [[Strahd Von Zarovich|Strahd]] and hesitates in battle
	- "Was [[Vargas Vallakovich|Vargas]] right about happiness keeping [[Strahd Von Zarovich|Strahd]] away all this time?"
	- but then his anger is rekindled
		- he blames [[Pelanil]] releasing the criminals for the coming of the Devil

## Feast of St Andral
[[The Town of Vallaki (N)#The Feast of St Andral]]
- The vamps run across town with the bones; or they chase the party if they have the bones
- They don't see [[Strahd Von Zarovich|Strahd]], timeline wise, until they're outside and like halfway across town
- The vampires may be attacking a known NPC, maybe [[Gadof Blinsky|Blinsky]] or [[Gunther Arasek]] or [[Ernst Larnak|Ernst]] (for [[Anakir]] to deal with) or [[Yeska]] or [[Milivoj]]
- The ravens may help fight in human or in bird form


## Vallaki is Burning
- Play the mini game
- destroy some of the buildings and kill some of the NPCs
