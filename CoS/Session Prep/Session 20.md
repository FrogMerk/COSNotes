### They Get Another Level After the Session
- or during so that I can waste time lol

- During a long rest, people usually eat
	- ask what everyone is having for dinner
	- [[Pelanil]] can't eat food anymore
		- when he eats it, he throws it up
		- He'll have to drink blood from somewhere (animals are fine) (don't tell the party that he needs blood)

- after waking up, they notice the air is becoming a bit more chilly and crisp
	- they've been in Barovia for a week
	- even though it's been on the chillier side of temperate, autumn seems to be giving way to winter

### Handling Incapacitated Vlad
- The party will probably run while the creatures are turned and [[Vladimir Horngaard|Vlad]] is down
- As they flee, they should encounter [[Sir Godfrey Gwilym|Godfrey]]
	- "Come, I know a place to hide. You'll never escape them on your own."
	- He explains everything, and he helps the group escape the castle on the condition that they help restore peace to the place
	- The hear rumbling in the background as the undead search for them
	- [[Sir Godfrey Gwilym|Godfrey]] takes them to the beacon; [[Vladimir Horngaard|Vlad]]'s curse has caused him to forget about it existence
		- After explaining everything, he'll use [[Bardolf]]'s rope to help them down
	- It's late now; He offers to take watch as the others sleep in the tower
- Alternatively, [[Ezmerelda d'Avenir|Ezmerelda]] shows up outside while they try to escape

### They either go to Krezk or the Winery
- At [[Village of Krezk (S)|Krezk]], they'll mainly get redirected to the winery, or they'll sneak in
- At the [[The Wizard of Wines (W)|Wizard of Wines]], they run into the Martikov family
