## Short Rest
- At the end of last session, [[Anakir]] realized the house seemed pretty quiet and empty
	- The group settled in for a short break upstairs
	- We'll start in the dining room this time
> You all are in a room with a large rectangular table with eight chairs, and it seems that the cabinets are full of food and wine, a luxury you haven't had in some time. As you settle in for your short rest, what do you?

- Work in the winery logs. Someone is messing around in the attached bedroom
- Play out the upstairs

## Pelanil
- Find and interact with [[Gadof Blinsky|Blinsky]] in the secret room [[The Wizard of Wines (W)#W14. Wine Cellar]]
	- Upon drinking blood, you get the benefits of a short rest
		- including, if you choose to spend just a few minutes in the room, getting more familiar with the staff you found last game

- [[Gulthias Staff]]
	- after inspecting this staff further, you come to realize what it can do
		- it seems that this staff is what is controlling the blights around the winery
		- it also seems, based on your magical knowledge, that this staff uses charges to create these blights
	- as you hold the staff in your hand, inspecting it, you notice that tiny black roots have grown from it and have crawled beneath your skin. It seems that it is currently drinking your blood
	- at this point, you have become attuned to it
	- and through those roots, it's as if the staff communicates to you
	- and you also learn that if the staff is destroyed, all the blights created by it will be instantly destroyed

- When leaving the secret room:
	- One [[Druid Assailant Statblock]], and all five [[Vine Blight Statblock]]
	- They druid casts thrunderwave and breaks the bottles, alerting the others


## Long Rest
- After the blights have been taken care of, [[Adrian Martikov|Adrian]] invites the group to stay the night in their house
- [[Davian Martikov|Davian]] warms up a bit to the party
	- maybe asks for their help making amends with [[Urwin Martikov|Urwin]]
- the kids should be running around having a good time
- talk to [[Bardolf]] about the rock eaters
- offer them some of the wine that the party already saw get poisoned

- [[Adrian Martikov|Adrian]] (or maybe [[Davian Martikov|Davian]]) tells the group that not all the [[Forest Folk]] used to be bad:
	- most of them have always been loyal to [[Strahd Von Zarovich|Strahd]]
	- actually, the [[Dmitri Krezkov|Krezkov]]s ([[The Keepers of the Feather|The Martikovs]] ancestors) used to be loyal to [[Strahd Von Zarovich|Strahd]] before his transformation and before the land was pulled from the rest of the world
		- [[Strahd Von Zarovich|Strahd]] gifted them this winery for their loyalty
	- A rebellious sect of [[Forest Folk]] begged for shelter against [[Strahd Von Zarovich|Strahd]]'s servants and [[The Keepers of the Feather|The Krezkovs]] accepted entering into a year-long guerrilla war that allowed these [[Forest Folk]] to evade [[Strahd Von Zarovich|Strahd]]'s eye
	- The good [[Forest Folk]] were eventually found and destroyed, but in their last breath of defiance, offered [[The Keepers of the Feather|The Krezkovs]] the gift of [[Lycanthropy]]
		- also hatching, the ritual by which to become a wereraven without losing their minds to animal instincts
	- When [[Strahd Von Zarovich|Strahd]] accepted the curse of vampirism, [[The Keepers of the Feather|The Krezkovs]] were alarmed at the shroud of darkness that fell over their new home
		- They joined together, recruiting extended family, creating [[The Keepers of the Feather]] to protect Barovians
		- After many years, [[The Keepers of the Feather|The Martikovs]] married into the family

- [[Adrian Martikov|Adrian]] asks them to check out what's going on in [[Yester Hill (Y)|Yester Hill]] and to retrieve the gem
	- so that their vineyard doesn't die
	- with the staff (not if it was destroyed), the [[Forest Folk|Mud Eaters]] should be easy to take

## Yester Hill
- They can explore, see the fog, climb the mountain
- at the right time (maybe after they've seen the [[Strahd Von Zarovich|Strahd]] statue), the bois start coming out of the rock towers and doing the ritual


- Clear the house
- attune to the staff
- kill all the blights
- hang out the night with the [[The Keepers of the Feather|Martikovs]]
- go to [[Yester Hill (Y)|Yester Hill]]
- go to [[Ruins of Berez (U)|Berez]]
