## Things To Resolve
- The tiger killed someone, so [[Vargas Vallakovich|The Burgomaster]] is after the Wachter brothers
	- The Wachter brothers are caught and hanged
	- If he catches them, [[Vargas Vallakovich|The Burgomaster]] may get hear from the brothers the [[Bardolf]] put them up to it
- The wolf hunters will come back in the evening with [[Carlos]] and will be expecting the rest of their payment
	- They also have news of [[Ismark Kolyanovich|Ismark]] in [[Village of Barovia (E)|Barovia Village]], a letter to [[Ireena Kolyana|Ireena]]

[[Ismark's Letter]]

>My dearest sister, life has become more difficult these days since your leaving. With father's death now publicly known, I've stepped up to fill the role of Burgomaster. But the villagers reject me. They refuse to be led by "The Lesser".
>
>I know that you would have been a better leader, Ireena. I just wish I had your political prowess. 
>
>Since yesterday, there seems to have been an outbreak of some new disease. More than half the town have taken to shuffling through the streets like the undead. They all sweat profusely and seem to shake uncontrollably. I've even seen some fall in the streets with seizures. Paranoia and confusion reign. Please send advice.
>
> Yours, Ismark

	- "My master, [[Fiona Wachter|Fiona]], has taken notice to your presence in town, and has requested that you join her for dinner this evening at her mansion"

## Town Square (maybe wait for this so that we can explore more of the town)
- There is a disturbance in the square at some point during the day
- The Wachter brothers are being hanged for their crime
	- [[Izek Strazni|Izek]] is doing the hanging
	- [[Elora]] can roll perception to realize that he looks similar to her
	- If he sees her, he drops what he's doing to pursue
- As the party approaches, [[Karl Wachter|Karl]] points to [[Bardolf]] and says that he paid them to do it
	- [[Izek Strazni|Izek]] tells the guards to seize him
	- They'll take him back to the Burgomaster's mansion

## Toymaker's Shop
