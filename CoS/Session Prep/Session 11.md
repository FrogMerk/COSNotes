## Rictavio
He entertains the crowed with a story:
>the air tinged with the scent of spiced ale and the warmth of camaraderie, a hushed murmur of excitement swirled through the patrons. Their attention was drawn to the figure standing tall before a makeshift stage, dressed in a vibrant ensemble of colorful garments and a wide-brimmed hat.

"Ladies and gentlemen, gather 'round, for tonight, I shall whisk you away to a realm where heroes clash with darkness, and untold wonders await!" Rictavio announced with a flourish, his voice captivating every ear in the tavern.

"Once, in a faraway land, amidst the lush emerald forests and soaring mountain peaks, there stood a grand citadel known as Valeranor. This shining beacon of civilization was a bastion of peace and unity, ruled by the wise King Alaric and his fair queen, Isabella. The kingdom prospered under their benevolent reign, and all who lived within its borders knew harmony and happiness."

"But as with many tales, dear listeners, a shadow lurked on the horizon. For deep in the dark recesses of the forbidden Blackwood, a malevolent sorceress, known as Morgana the Maleficent, plotted her revenge. She had been cast out of the kingdom for her wicked ways, and now, her heart burned with fury and desire for retribution."

...

- The party can roll perception to see what else is going on:
	- The Martikov boys are running around
	- The Wachter boys are giggling and making fun of the story

"And now, as the carnival's banners dance in the wind, we celebrate the triumph of light over darkness, of unity over discord. So, let us revel in the wonders of this night, for together, we stand strong against any shadow that may seek to darken our hearts!"

>As Rictavio's tale concluded, the patrons erupted into applause, enchanted by the spell of his storytelling.
