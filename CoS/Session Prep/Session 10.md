## Recap
- Include that the whole reason you're coming to [[The Town of Vallaki (N)|Vallaki]] is that [[Ireena Kolyana|Ireena]] and [[Ismark Kolyanovich|Ismark]] said it was well guarded

## Talking with the Children
- [[Freek]] is mistouched (soulless)
	- [[Lucien]] may explain that he never saw him go into the mists
	- [[Myrtle]] may say, "He doesn't have a soul" really bluntly, like she knows it's a fact
		- [[Lucien]] can follow up with "It's said that not everyone in Barovia is born with a soul. Some people are just shells"
	- [[Myrtle]]: "That's why the witches were pricking my finger. When they pricked [[Freek]]'s, he didn't cry"

## Elora's Tail
- Let her explain that she's had to deal with it her whole life
- (if anyone else in the party wants to add a little backstory flavor, feel free. Or let me know if I can help)
