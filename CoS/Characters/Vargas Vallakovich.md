## History/Info
### Origin Story
- Was a victim of child abuse by his father

### About

	- If the guards fail in their duty, the baron sends [[Izek Strazni]] to rally a mob of thirty [[Commoner|Commoners]] to lynch the party
	- If the commoners also fail, the baron summons the twelve remaining guards to defend his mansion, giving characters the run of the town
- He has two pet mastiffs that follow him everywhere
	- as well as a murderous and deformed henchman named [[Izek Strazni]]
