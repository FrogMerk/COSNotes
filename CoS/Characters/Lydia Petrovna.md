## Playing Lydia Petrovna
- At the risk of sacrificing her sanity, she has embraced her husband's philosophy of happiness
	- She laughs at [[Vargas Vallakovich|The Baron]]'s every comment, to the extent that it has become a nervous reflex
	- she tries to spread good cheer by throwing daily tea-and-sandwich parties in the parlor for her "dearest friends," many of them poor folk who tolerate the baroness only because they crave something warm to eat and drink
- Lydia is a gods-fearing woman and the younger sister of the town priest, [[Father Lucian Petrovich]]
- She is a descendant of [[Tasha Petrovna]], a priest entombed in [[Castle Ravenloft (K)|Castle Ravenloft]] ([[area K84]])
- She is the secret evil in town

## History/Info
- She's so clearly lost to [[Vargas Vallakovich|Vargas]]'s brainwashing that she can barely process other info
	- If players say anything un-kosher, she blinks as if she doesn't hear and laughs nervously
