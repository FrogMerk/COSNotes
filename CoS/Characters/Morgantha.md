## History/Info
- Morgantha gave her coven's [[Hag Eye]] to [[Cyrus Belview]]
	- so she can keep an eye on [[Strahd Von Zarovich|Strahd]]
- She's fearful of [[Strahd Von Zarovich|Strahd]], and respects his dominion over this land

## Playing Morgantha/Granny
### As Granny Selling Dream Pies
- Most loving grandmotherly person in the world
	- kind to a fault and a shameless gossip
- Have her tell round-about-truths instead of outright lies
	- in case players insight check her, there's nothing to hide
- If players ask for her name: "Why it's Morgantha, dear. But everyone just calls me Granny. Morgantha is much to formal"
- If players check her and sense she's a fiend:
	- She sees a look on their face and asks what's wrong.
	- If prodded:
		- Tell horrible story about how mother had a nasty encounter with a witch that left its stain on the whole family (technically true)
		- hidden truth: Morgantha devoured her mother when she was younger
- Knows a little about everyone in the village
	- because she has to keep track of her clients

## At Old Bonegrinder
- Morgantha can use the barrel as a font for a [[Scrying]] spell. She can also knock on the barrel three times as an action to summon a [[dretch]]. The demon crawls out of the barrel at the end of Morgantha's turn and obeys the night hag's commands for 1 hour, after which it dissolves into a pool of ichor. Morgantha can summon up to nine dretches in this manner before the ichor is gone.

## Relations
- Daughters: [[Bella Sunbane]], [[Offalia Wormwiggle]]
