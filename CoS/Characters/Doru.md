## Playing Doru
- He's starved for blood and will attack a lone character
	- If the PCs approach as a group, he does his best to avoid while hissing, "I can smell your blood!"
		- If they cut off his escape, he lunges forth and attacks
- He's starving, but can't die as a vampire; he's in a lot of pain
	- a pint of blood isn't enough
	- if they offer him some of their blood, it'll lead to battle when his thirst takes over his sanity
- If the PCs restrain and either:

	- threaten to destroy him or
	- kill him and raise him from the dead
	- Then, he will recount the events that led to his downfall
