## Playing Henrik van der Voort
- Think: Eeyore from Pooh
- not much of a conversationalist
	- grunts or one word responses
- no joy in life
	- afraid of death because it must be worse
- a mediocre carpenter and a troubled, lonely man
- no one desires his company, because of the ghastly nature of his handiwork

## History/Info
- One night several months ago, [[Strahd Von Zarovich|Strahd]] visited Henrik in the guise of an imposing, well-dressed nobleman named [[Strahd Von Zarovich|Vasili von Holtz]] and promised the coffin maker "good business" in exchange for his help.
	- Since then, Henrik's workshop has become the lair of a pack of vampire spawnâ€”former adventurers who were turned by Strahd.
	- These vampires are lying low for the time being.
