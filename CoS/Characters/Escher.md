## Playing Escher
- **Would abosolutely flirt with [[Anakir]]**
- In conversation, Escher displays wit with a hint of melancholy
- Beneath his arch mood is a dread that Strahd is growing bored of him and will lock him in the catacombs ([area K84](https://longo.com.br/5e/adventure.html#CoS,4,k84.%20catacombs)) with Strahd's other castoff consorts
- The Posh Socialite
    - one of the few sympathetic spawn in the castle
	    - He drinks blood willingly, so he's maintained his mind, but he takes no joy in battle
	    - He's a lover, not a fighter
    - Escher is extremely well dressed, if a bit overly so
	    - He loves fine clothes
    - Escher is a very social individual
	    - He loves talking to people and is very open and confident
	    - He's actually been quite downtrodden over recent years, since Castle Ravenloft has few people worth talking to
- Escher's Insecurities
    - In an initial meeting, Escher should come across as overly confident
	    - He speaks his mind, is open about his sexuality, and overall knows he's a hot dish
	    - However, longer conversations and/or additional encounters should reveal his inner workings
    - Escher is, first and foremost, lonely
	    - He doesn't get along with any of the castle's current residents and Strahd has most certainly grown tired of him, which Escher suspects but doesn't know for certain
	    - He knows what Strahd will do to him in the end (seal him away in the crypts) and it absolutely terrifies him
	    - An eternity without human interaction or everyday comforts would be hell to Escher.
- Escher's deepest fears are being unwanted and unloved, both of which are coming true. And that terrifies him. This motivation can go one of two ways with your party. Either the players become a source of friendship to Escher, offering him better connections than his vampiric ones and Escher therefore switches sides. Or, Escher's desperation to remain unforgotten by Strahd will turn him into an enemy. Whichever happens will depend on your players' interactions with him.
    - Should Escher switch sides, remember that he's still a spawn and must obey Strahd's orders. He's clever enough to work around the wording of different commands, but he'll make it clear to the party that his actions cannot always be his own, and he's very sorry about that.
    - Should Escher switch sides, Strahd just might put up with it for a little bit. It's probably the most interesting thing Escher's done in a while in Strahd's opinion. However, the end result will absolutely be Strahd crushing Escher. Such a blatant traitor will have to pay in the end. Unless, of course, the players deal will Strahd fast enough to save him.
- In-Game Flirting
    - In general, always be careful when you put romance in a dnd game. And that's romance of any sort, not just here with Escher. Make sure you know your players and what they are and are not comfortable with so that you don't cross any lines. Romance can be a real picky subject in dnd, so just tread lightly.
    - However, if you _do_ have a party that's comfortable with flirting and whatnot, Escher interactions are the absolute best. If there's a particularly attractive male in your group of PCs, Escher will totally flirt with them. Remember, Escher is lonely and seeking companionship, even if it's meaningless sex. Heaven knows Strahd's not much fun right now.
    - Having Escher come on to a guy in your group can be something right out of a sitcom, and it was hella fun for my players and I. Just remember that if the players continue to converse with Escher, his true personality should come through. Escher is far more than "the gay, horny guy" and players should be able to see that.

## History/Info
- a dashing vampire spawn to whom [[Strahd Von Zarovich|Strahd]] has shown favor in the past
- Escher is feeling somewhat neglected of late and is waiting for Strahd's mood to improve
- If attacked, he hurls himself out the window and lands like a cat on the roof of the keep ([area K53](https://longo.com.br/5e/adventure.html#CoS,4,k53.%20rooftop))
- He leads pursuers right to Strahd, wherever the lord of the castle happens to be (and regardless of whether the characters are ready to face Strahd).
