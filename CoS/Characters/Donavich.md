(LN male human acolyte)
![[donavich.jpeg|200]]
**Voice**: Always seems to be kinda out of breath and almost crying

## Playing Donavich
- His voice is hoarse and weak from praying throughout the night
- He's basically driven himself insane and acts frantic
- He cannot be convinced to kill his son or advocate for it
- He knows his son still within the monster
	- and believes in his heart that [[The Morninglord]] will set [[Doru]] free
	- what's left of his sanity relies on this belief; shattering that hope would destroy [[Donavich]]
- PCs can offer to take a look at [[Doru]] and [[Donavich]] will agree
	- He warns the party that no harm can come to his son
- If it seems like the PCs will kill [[Doru]], [[Donavich]] will descend himself and fight them

## History/Info
- A little over a year ago his son, [[Doru]], and several other villagers stormed [[Castle Ravenloft (K)]] in revolt
	- having been lured there by a wizard in black robes who came to Barovia from a faraway land
		- {the [[Mad Mage of Mount Baratok|Mad Mage]]}
- By all accounts, the wizard died by [[Strahd Von Zarovich|Strahd]]'s hand and so too did [[Doru]]
- [[Doru]] returned to his father as a vampire spawn
	- [[Donavich]] trapped [[Doru]] in the [[Village of Barovia (E)#Church (E5)#Trap Door and Undercroft|Church Undercroft]] where he remains

## If [[Doru]] is Killed
- Donavich becomes withdrawn and inconsolable
- When the PCs leave the church, they can hear the church bell ring a single time
- If the party returns to the church, they find that Donavich has hanged himself from the bell's rope

## What They Want
- He wants his son back

## What They Know
[[Barovian Lore]]
- [[Ireena Kolyana]] isn't the natural daughter of [[Kolyan Indirovich]]. Although [[Ireena Kolyana|Ireena]] never knew, [[Kolyan Indirovich|Koylan]] found her at the edge of the [[Svalich Woods (C)]] near the [[Pillarstone of Ravenloft]]. She was but a girl then and seemed to have no memory of her past. [[Kolyan Indirovich|Koylan]] adopted her and loved her dearly
