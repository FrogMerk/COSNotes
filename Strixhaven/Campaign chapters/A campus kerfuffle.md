## Adventure Overview
The strange happenings on campus in this adventure are caused by a corrupted substance known as eldritch balm. Used at Strixhaven for decades, eldritch balm is an alchemical salve made from the sludgy, acidic waters of Sedgemoor, the bayou that encompasses the Witherbloom College campus. Once these waters undergo an alchemical process in Witherbloom's faculty laboratories, the resulting eldritch balm is used to magically treat and strengthen objects, from storage trunks to cooking vats to stage props and more. The balm's effects differ depending on the objects treated, but it typically provides resistance to certain types of damage or other protections useful on a campus where magic often goes awry.

Unknown to anyone on campus, Sedgemoor's waters were recently corrupted by the foul magic practiced by [[Murgaxor]] Grenshel, the villain the characters ultimately confront in chapter 6. [[Murgaxor]] intended the eldritch balm to be affected by his sinister experiments and hoped the resulting chaos would disrupt life at Strixhaven.

## Changes to recommended play
We will not be running the recommended additional mechanics for monitoring Jobs, Extracurriculars, Friends, Rivals and Exams. Instead, a selection of custom made characters will be available to run into as the party go about their lives on campus.  Additionally any academic element to this campaign is considered background, and these optional mechanics will only serve to slow down play. Unless given a good reason, exams and study will be considered done in the background and will be described as a tool to connote the passage of time.


# Introduction
The [[Acceptance letter]] provided to players before the campaign begins.

The characters arrive at [[the Dawnbow]], and are introduced to the university by {INSERTNAME}, a highly enthusiastic 2nd year student who is quickly ushered away by a Rather Stern and serious looking [[Augusta Tullus]] (lawful neutral human [[Lorehold professor of order]]). If the party choose to roll a perception (DC 15) or Insight (DC15) check they will notice that the professor seems agitated and lacking sleep, her appearance not quite matching the tone of her speech.

Professor Tullus steps forward to speak, deliver the following:

```ad-quote
Professor Augusta Tullus steps onto the shimmering stone dais at the heart of Central Campus, the radiant arcs of the Dawnbow gleaming overhead in a thousand shifting hues. She gazes out at the gathered students with sharp eyes, her face betraying no sense of emotion.

"Welcome, first-years… to Strixhaven University. Look around you. Take in the soaring towers, the whispering trees, the spells that hang in the very air you breathe. Take your time to walk the Halls, the Gardens, the Streets, explore each small corner that holds within it the _history_ of this institution. Here, you will be tested, transformed, and, if you rise to the challenge, truly awakened."

She pauses, her tone shifting slightly, a slight tension appearing on her face.

"Beneath the Dawnbow, this ancient arc of woven light, you stand where countless great minds once stood, uncertain but unafraid. Many of you will stumble. Some will soar. Strixhaven rewards those that grasp greatness."

Her face relaxes again.

"So, take your place. Ask dangerous questions. Cast impossible spells. And never, _ever_ forget: Strixhaven is watching."

```

After stepping away, {INSERTNAME} rushes back to the podium and excitedly informs those in attendance that there will be a guided tour and Orientation Challenge taking place in [[the Biblioplex]] shortly

The players can then be introduced to one another as they make their way towards [[the Biblioplex]].


# Orientation Challenge
The Orientation Challenge begins in the Hall of Oracles, within [[the Biblioplex]]. Read [[the Biblioplex]] introduction at this point. Explain each area of the Biblioplex from the locations page at this point to give the players an idea of what rooms are around the building. Provide the [[Biblioplex Map]] handout so they can annotate it.

When the characters enter the Hall of Oracles to begin orientation, read or paraphrase the following:

```ad-quote
An almost sacrosanct sense of calm descends as you step into the Hall of Oracles. "Brilliant scholars," says a rich, soothing voice radiating from the hall's central snarl of glowing energy. "Your attention, please.

"As you are now Strixhaven University students, this storied Biblioplex will be your second home for research, studies, and even leisure. There is just one task to accomplish before you officially embark on your academic journey—a scavenger hunt!"
```

A small parchment materializes in front of the characters. It presents a list of clues.

```ad-quote
"The rules are simple," the voice says. "Each clue on this list will lead you to a different location in [[the Biblioplex]]. Simply travel to the area each clue references and perform the action the clue suggests. Time is of the essence. You have only until the end of the day to finish your hunt.

"Solve as many clues as you can, because at each location, you may win a prize! Now then, off you go!"
```

## Scavenger Hunt Clues
A character can win a prize for each clue they solve but can receive only one item in each place. If a character tries to redo a clue to receive a second item, the magic that reveals the item doesn't work again. 

Each clue can be unraveled either by deduction, or with a successful DC 10 Intelligence (Investigation) check. A decoded clue points the characters toward one of the areas of [[the Biblioplex]] as well as the action they must take to receive a prize in that area.

Here are the clues:

### Clue 1
You'll forget all about any trouble or plight when you step forward and are ensnarled in light.
Hall of oracles light?

### Clue 2
Alumni commission works when they retire, seeking promising mages to inspire.
Student and alumni art gallery?

### Clue 3
Each group deserves a free treat for their investment. Serve up this list and enjoy your refreshment.
Cafe?
### Clue 4
These leafy beds aren't always what they seem. Give them a pat and see what you glean.
Book Garden

### Clue 5
Some stars are ancient, enduring, and bright. But others—maybe you!—are born on opening night.
Ampitheatre
