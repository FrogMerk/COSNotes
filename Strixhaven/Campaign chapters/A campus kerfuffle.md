## Adventure Overview
The strange happenings on campus in this adventure are caused by a corrupted substance known as eldritch balm. Used at Strixhaven for decades, eldritch balm is an alchemical salve made from the sludgy, acidic waters of Sedgemoor, the bayou that encompasses the Witherbloom College campus. Once these waters undergo an alchemical process in Witherbloom's faculty laboratories, the resulting eldritch balm is used to magically treat and strengthen objects, from storage trunks to cooking vats to stage props and more. The balm's effects differ depending on the objects treated, but it typically provides resistance to certain types of damage or other protections useful on a campus where magic often goes awry.

Unknown to anyone on campus, Sedgemoor's waters were recently corrupted by the foul magic practiced by [[Murgaxor]] Grenshel, the villain the characters ultimately confront in chapter 6. [[Murgaxor]] intended the eldritch balm to be affected by his sinister experiments and hoped the resulting chaos would disrupt life at Strixhaven.

## Changes to recommended play
We will not be running the recommended additional mechanics for monitoring Jobs, Extracurriculars, Friends, Rivals and Exams. Instead, a selection of custom made characters will be available to run into as the party go about their lives on campus.  Additionally any academic element to this campaign is considered background, and these optional mechanics will only serve to slow down play. Unless given a good reason, exams and study will be considered done in the background and will be described as a tool to connote the passage of time.

With the characters arrive at the Dawnbow, read or paraphrase the following:

```ad-important
**The Dawnbow** is a breathtaking arc of floating, opalescent-veined stones that hang frozen in midair above the Biblioplex - the beating heart of Strixhaven’s magical knowledge. Its stones glow vibrantly with shifting hues, refracting the ambient magic of the planes. Students often gather to watch the light of the setting sun dance across the Dawnbow, said to be one of the most beautiful sights in all of Arcavios.

Students and scholars alike look to it for inspiration, tradition, and sometimes, omens. Some say it was formed at the founding of Strixhaven by the first convergence of the five colleges’ magic, others claim it predates even the dragons themselves. Regardless of its origin, the Dawnbow is a radiant sigil in the skies of Arcavios — a symbol of limitless possibility and the pursuit of knowledge without end.

```ad-important
**The Biblioplex** is the crown jewel of Strixhaven University, a vast, awe-inspiring library where magic and intellect entwine in endless pursuit of truth. Towering marble archways are etched with glowing runes and trimmed with gilded ivy, and stretch high into vaulted ceilings that shimmer faintly with starlight, regardless of the hour. 

The air hums with energy. Sparks of wild, uncontained magic dance across the fingertips of students practicing cantrips between study sessions, while scholarly debates erupt over obscure theories of spellcraft, punctuated by flashes of light and laughter.

Quiet corners of this grand 

Despite its grandeur, the Biblioplex never feels cold or impersonal. There's a warmth that radiates from the pursuit of knowledge itself — a palpable, infectious drive shared by hundreds of young minds from every corner of Arcavios and beyond. Every hallway, every hidden study nook, every whispering alcove feels like it holds a secret waiting to be discovered.

Above it all, the Dawnbow hovers — silent, luminous, ever-present — casting shifting light through the stained-glass oculi in the ceiling, bathing the interior in ethereal hues as if the very sky is reading along.

To walk into the Biblioplex is to step into a living spell — a place where curiosity bends reality, and where learning is not just revered, but alive.
