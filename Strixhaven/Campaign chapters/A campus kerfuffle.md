## Adventure Overview
The strange happenings on campus in this adventure are caused by a corrupted substance known as eldritch balm. Used at Strixhaven for decades, eldritch balm is an alchemical salve made from the sludgy, acidic waters of Sedgemoor, the bayou that encompasses the Witherbloom College campus. Once these waters undergo an alchemical process in Witherbloom's faculty laboratories, the resulting eldritch balm is used to magically treat and strengthen objects, from storage trunks to cooking vats to stage props and more. The balm's effects differ depending on the objects treated, but it typically provides resistance to certain types of damage or other protections useful on a campus where magic often goes awry.

Unknown to anyone on campus, Sedgemoor's waters were recently corrupted by the foul magic practiced by [[Murgaxor]] Grenshel, the villain the characters ultimately confront in chapter 6. [[Murgaxor]] intended the eldritch balm to be affected by his sinister experiments and hoped the resulting chaos would disrupt life at Strixhaven.

## Changes to recommended play
We will not be running the recommended additional mechanics for monitoring Jobs, Extracurriculars, Friends, Rivals and Exams. Instead, a selection of custom made characters will be available to run into as the party go about their lives on campus.  Additionally any academic element to this campaign is considered background, and these optional mechanics will only serve to slow down play. Unless given a good reason, exams and study will be considered done in the background and will be described as a tool to connote the passage of time.


# Orientation
The [[Acceptance letter]] provided to players before the campaign begins.

The characters arrive at [[the Dawnbow]], and are introduced to the university by a highly enthusiastic 2nd year student who is quickly ushered away by a Rather Stern and serious looking [[Augusta Tullus]] (lawful neutral human [[Lorehold professor of order]]). If the party choose to roll a perception (DC 15) or Insight (DC15) check they will notice that the professor seems agitated and lacking sleep, her appearance not quite matching the tone of her speech.

Professor Tullus steps forward to speak, deliver the following:

```ad-quote
Professor Augusta Tullus steps onto the shimmering stone dais at the heart of Central Campus, the radiant arcs of the Dawnbow gleaming overhead in a thousand shifting hues. She gazes out at the gathered students with sharp eyes, her face betraying no sense of emotion.

"Welcome, first-years… to Strixhaven University. Look around you. Take in the soaring towers, the whispering trees, the spells that hang in the very air you breathe. Take your time to walk the Halls, the Gardens, the Streets, explore each small corner that holds within it the _history_ of this institution. Here, you will be tested, transformed, and, if you rise to the challenge, truly awakened.

Beneath the Dawnbow, this ancient arc of woven light, you stand where countless great minds once stood, uncertain but unafraid. You may arrive as students of different colleges—Silverquill, Prismari, Witherbloom, Lorehold, Quandrix—but you are all bound by one thing: the pursuit of knowledge that _matters_.

Some of you will stumble. Some of you will soar. But _all_ of you are meant to be here.

So, take your place. Ask dangerous questions. Cast impossible spells. And never, _ever_ forget: Strixhaven is watching."
