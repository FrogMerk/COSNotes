## Adventure Overview
The strange happenings on campus in this adventure are caused by a corrupted substance known as eldritch balm. Used at Strixhaven for decades, eldritch balm is an alchemical salve made from the sludgy, acidic waters of Sedgemoor, the bayou that encompasses the Witherbloom College campus. Once these waters undergo an alchemical process in Witherbloom's faculty laboratories, the resulting eldritch balm is used to magically treat and strengthen objects, from storage trunks to cooking vats to stage props and more. The balm's effects differ depending on the objects treated, but it typically provides resistance to certain types of damage or other protections useful on a campus where magic often goes awry.

Unknown to anyone on campus, Sedgemoor's waters were recently corrupted by the foul magic practiced by [[Murgaxor]] Grenshel, the villain the characters ultimately confront in chapter 6. [[Murgaxor]] intended the eldritch balm to be affected by his sinister experiments and hoped the resulting chaos would disrupt life at Strixhaven.

## Changes to recommended play
We will not be running the recommended additional mechanics for monitoring Jobs, Extracurriculars, Friends, Rivals and Exams. Instead, a selection of custom made characters will be available to run into as the party go about their lives on campus.  Additionally any academic element to this campaign is considered background, and these optional mechanics will only serve to slow down play. Unless given a good reason, exams and study will be considered done in the background and will be described as a tool to connote the passage of time.
