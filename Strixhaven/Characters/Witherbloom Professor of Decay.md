Professors of decay wield magic that drains and twists the essence of the professors' subjects. The professors use the gathered essence to feed their magic, snuffing the life and decaying the bodies of the living, entreating and commanding the dead and Undead, and twisting curses around their foes. In battle, they steal the essence of their enemies to heal their own wounds and create spears of sickly green life-draining energy.

Witherbloom teachers who espouse the decaying side of the natural cycle instruct their students to exploit the essence of life for their own needs. Professors of decay unravel the mysteries of death and the transition of decay, and they teach that any life's end is an asset waiting to be tapped.
