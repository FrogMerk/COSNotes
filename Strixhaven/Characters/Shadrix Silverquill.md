Centuries ago, the dragon Shadrix Silverquill mastered the magic of light and shadow, and he focused that magic through communication. Shadrix's words thrummed with power, inspiring his allies and demoralizing his enemies.

He established Silverquill College on the principles of eloquence and leadership, seeking to produce leaders who would go forth to guide others.
