The center of Strixhaven is the Biblioplex, the university's main library. At the heart of the library is a snarl, a tangle in the fabric of magic, that glows like a miniature sun in the grand Hall of Oracles. A star arch called the Dawnbow curves across the sky above the library, marking its location as a center of mystic learning.

Arches welcome inquisitive minds into the library. Inside, almost every surface from the floor to the high ceiling is jammed with stacks of books. The interior of the Biblioplex is vast, with long hallways, archive chambers tall enough to have their own weather, and even pools and moat-passages crossable only by boat.

Five lines of beacon-towers radiate from the Biblioplex like enormous spokes. These Torches of Enlightenment stretch out to the five college campuses and beyond, more than a hundred miles into the surrounding countryside. They burn perpetually with magical flame, symbolising the path toward learning and an escape from ignorance.

The Biblioplex library acts as a hub for learning and gathering for students across Strixhaven. Before the characters begin the "Orientation Challenge" event, they might wish to explore the library. The map below is the DM version, for the player version, provide the [[Biblioplex Map]] in the handouts folder.

## Biblioplex Locations
The following locations are keyed to map 3.1. All descriptions assume the characters are wandering the Biblioplex during the day. At night, the library is locked and devoid of other students or staff.

### B1. Main Entrance
Enchanted marble steps lead up 5 feet to a small plaza at the Biblioplex's entrance. The double door's vertical handles are each carved in the likeness of a robed scholar. During the day, the doors stand open. At night, the doors are closed, locked, and sealed with an arcane lock spell. A successful DC 25 Dexterity check using thieves' tools opens the lock (DC 35 while the arcane lock is in effect). Only the Biblioplex's reference librarians and certain faculty members know the arcane lock's password.
### B2. Biblioplex Lounge
Luxurious couches and sturdy tables furnish this spacious area. Students, employees, and staff members often use this lounge to relax between shifts in the [[student store]] (area B5), the Biblioplex café (area B6), or elsewhere in the library. Each table holds piles of magazines, newsletters, flyers, and nonmagical scrolls from around campus. A character who examines these materials finds recruitment flyers from 1d3 Extracurriculars. They also find "Help Wanted" ads for the Jobs at the Biblioplex. Extracurriculars and Jobs are detailed earlier in the chapter.
### B3. Student Café Seating
This area typically holds 21 (6d6) students, all of them studying, eating, chatting, or even sleeping. Many enjoy food and drinks from the café (area B6).
### B4. Information Desk
Three faculty-appointed reference librarians work at each of these circular desks (use any of the professor stat blocks found in chapter 7 if needed). All are expert scholars and powerful mages. They can provide helpful instructions for where to find any public location or collection in the Biblioplex.
### B5. [[Student Store]]
This small shop is stocked with books, equipment, and gear useful as academic supplies. The store's manager is Groff Lundquist (neutral good human commoner), a friendly Strixhaven staff member known for his ability to fashionably mix and match items of university apparel. Students can buy hats, scarves, tunics, robes, gloves, and other apparel embroidered with the Strixhaven star or with the sigil of any of Strixhaven's colleges. Costs range from 5 cp to 5 gp or more, at your discretion.

Once a character chooses a college at the start of second year, they receive a set of college robes, a knit hat, a scarf, a tunic, and gloves free of charge. (This set normally costs 5 gp.)

In addition to nonmagical gear and clothing, the [[student store]] also contains the magic items from the "Magic Items" section of chapter 2.
### B6. Biblioplex Café
One wall of this area is covered with a mural made from a living tree's roots, which move occasionally and make the entire place feel alive. The ceiling is covered in painted leaves, which change colors depending on the season thanks to a permanent illusion effect. The magic also prompts painted squirrels to run up and down the mural's roots, and painted birds to chirp among the leaves.

Up to ten students are typically present here during the day. Ordinarily, three more students work here, but during orientation, the café's manager, Aisla Fitzbottom (chaotic good gnome commoner), is working alone. She is charmingly perky and has a mind like a steel trap when it comes to recognizing students. However, her organizational skills are somewhat lackadaisical.

The café always serves coffee and tea, which costs 1 cp per cup. The sandwich of the day varies. Roll below to determine which sandwich is available on any given day in the café.

### B7. Lecture Hall
Each of these halls hosts interdisciplinary lectures for Strixhaven students. The seats magically grow or shrink to comfortably accommodate students of any size or body type. The halls' acoustics are magically enhanced to amplify the professor's lecture and minimize the disruption of side conversations. While a class is in session, each hall holds a professor and up to thirty students.
### B8. Study Area
These open study areas feature simple wooden tables and chairs. During the day, up to thirty students can typically be found here.

If the characters pass by the western study area before orientation, members of the Live-Action Roleplaying Guild are pulling costumes and props from a half dozen old trunks. The guild is preparing for an event later on the Biblioplex's lawn: a game they call Beholders versus Behirs. Rosie Wuzfeddlims (chaotic good gnome first-year student; see the "Fellow Students" section) is directing students as they cobble together beholder and behir costumes, as well as visual effects made from sheets, blankets, wooden frames, tin plates, and illusion magic. (This preparation erupts into chaos during "That Trunk Has Teeth!" later in this chapter.)
### B9. Book Garden
In these quiet areas, students sit on the grass and study among lush foliage. Sometime last year, three awakened shrubs wandered in here and settled in each garden, and the university has welcomed them to stay. Members of Witherbloom College typically tend this space, and three Witherbloom pledgemages (see chapter 7) can be found here most days.

Members of the Fantastical Horticulture Club often relax in this area and hold meetings here from time to time. If the characters explore this area before or after orientation, Urzmaktok Grojsh (neutral orc Witherbloom apprentice; see the "Fellow Students" section) is here, recruiting first-year students to the club. 
### B10. Main Stacks
Floor-to-ceiling bookshelves fill the center and the east end of the library's first floor, with the denser east stacks under a magic effect that shifts them when students approach, creating space to stand single-file between them. These books are mostly introductory texts, and first-year students are often directed here by their instructors. In each of these areas, two [[Cogwork Archivists]] (see chapter 7) busily shelve returned or misfiled books.

Characters who browse these shelves unaided stumble on what they need with a successful DC 15 Wisdom (Perception) check. However, it's always easier to ask a reference librarian (area B4).
### B11. Hall of Oracles
This hallowed hall is filled with statues of the university's past Oracles. At the center of the hall, a pulsing ball of magical energy—the Strixhaven Snarl—fills the area with bright light. See {} for information about snarls and the Oracle.

The "Orientation Challenge" event starts here.
