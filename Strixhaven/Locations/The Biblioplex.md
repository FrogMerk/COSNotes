The center of Strixhaven is the Biblioplex, the university's main library. At the heart of the library is a snarl, a tangle in the fabric of magic, that glows like a miniature sun in the grand Hall of Oracles. A star arch called the Dawnbow curves across the sky above the library, marking its location as a center of mystic learning.

Arches welcome inquisitive minds into the library. Inside, almost every surface from the floor to the high ceiling is jammed with stacks of books. The interior of the Biblioplex is vast, with long hallways, archive chambers tall enough to have their own weather, and even pools and moat-passages crossable only by boat.

Five lines of beacon-towers radiate from the Biblioplex like enormous spokes. These Torches of Enlightenment stretch out to the five college campuses and beyond, more than a hundred miles into the surrounding countryside. They burn perpetually with magical flame, symbolising the path toward learning and an escape from ignorance.

The Biblioplex library acts as a hub for learning and gathering for students across Strixhaven. Before the characters begin the "Orientation Challenge" event, they might wish to explore the library. The map below is the DM version, for the player version, provide the [[Biblioplex Map]] in the handouts folder.

## Biblioplex Locations
The following locations are keyed to map 3.1. All descriptions assume the characters are wandering the Biblioplex during the day. At night, the library is locked and devoid of other students or staff.

### B1. Main Entrance
Enchanted marble steps lead up 5 feet to a small plaza at the Biblioplex's entrance. The double door's vertical handles are each carved in the likeness of a robed scholar. During the day, the doors stand open. At night, the doors are closed, locked, and sealed with an arcane lock spell. A successful DC 25 Dexterity check using thieves' tools opens the lock (DC 35 while the arcane lock is in effect). Only the Biblioplex's reference librarians and certain faculty members know the arcane lock's password.
