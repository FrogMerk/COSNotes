## Adventure Overview
The strange happenings on campus in this adventure are caused by a corrupted substance known as eldritch balm. Used at Strixhaven for decades, eldritch balm is an alchemical salve made from the sludgy, acidic waters of Sedgemoor, the bayou that encompasses the Witherbloom College campus. Once these waters undergo an alchemical process in Witherbloom's faculty laboratories, the resulting eldritch balm is used to magically treat and strengthen objects, from storage trunks to cooking vats to stage props and more. The balm's effects differ depending on the objects treated, but it typically provides resistance to certain types of damage or other protections useful on a campus where magic often goes awry.

Unknown to anyone on campus, Sedgemoor's waters were recently corrupted by the foul magic practiced by [[Murgaxor]] Grenshel, the villain the characters ultimately confront in chapter 6. [[Murgaxor]] intended the eldritch balm to be affected by his sinister experiments and hoped the resulting chaos would disrupt life at Strixhaven.
## Changes to recommended play
We will not be running the recommended additional mechanics for monitoring Jobs, Extracurriculars, Friends, Rivals and Exams. Instead, a selection of custom characters will be available to run into as the party go about their lives on campus.  Additionally any academic element to this campaign is considered background, and these optional mechanics will only serve to slow down play. Unless given a good reason, exams and study will be considered completed in the background and will be described as a tool to connote the passage of time. If the players wish to conduct any roleplay around this, I'm happy to integrate some elements.
# Introduction
The [[Acceptance Letter]] provided to players before the campaign begins.

The characters arrive at [[The Dawnbow]], and are introduced to the university by {INSERTNAME}, a highly enthusiastic 2nd year student who is quickly ushered away by a Rather Stern and serious looking [[Augusta Tullus]] (lawful neutral human [[Lorehold professor of order]]). If the party choose to roll a perception (DC 15) or Insight (DC 15) check they will notice that the professor seems agitated and lacking sleep, her appearance not quite matching the tone of her speech.

Professor Tullus steps forward to speak, deliver the following:

```ad-quote
Professor Augusta Tullus steps onto the shimmering stone dais at the heart of Central Campus, the radiant arcs of the Dawnbow gleaming overhead in a thousand shifting hues. She gazes out at the gathered students with sharp eyes, her face betraying no sense of emotion.

"Welcome, first-years… to Strixhaven University. Look around you. Take in the soaring towers, the whispering trees, the spells that hang in the very air you breathe. Take your time to walk the Halls, the Gardens, the Streets, explore each small corner that holds within it the _history_ of this institution. Here, you will be tested, transformed, and, if you rise to the challenge, truly awakened."

She pauses, her tone shifting slightly, a slight tension appearing on her face.

"Beneath the Dawnbow, this ancient arc of woven light, you stand where countless great minds once stood, uncertain but unafraid. Many of you will stumble. Some will soar. Strixhaven rewards those that grasp greatness."

Her face relaxes again.

"So, take your place. Ask dangerous questions. Cast impossible spells. And never, _ever_ forget: Strixhaven is watching."

```

After stepping away, {INSERTNAME} rushes back to the podium and excitedly informs those in attendance that there will be a guided tour and Orientation Challenge taking place in [[The Biblioplex]] shortly

The players can then be introduced to one another as they make their way towards [[The Biblioplex]].
# Orientation Challenge
The Orientation Challenge begins in the Hall of Oracles, within [[The Biblioplex]]. Read [[The Biblioplex]] introduction at this point. Explain each area of the Biblioplex from the locations page at this point to give the players an idea of what rooms are around the building. Provide the [[Biblioplex Map]] handout so they can annotate it.

When the characters enter the Hall of Oracles to begin orientation, read or paraphrase the following:

```ad-quote
An almost sacrosanct sense of calm descends as you step into the Hall of Oracles. "Brilliant scholars," says a rich, soothing voice radiating from the hall's central snarl of glowing energy. "Your attention, please.

"As you are now Strixhaven University students, this storied Biblioplex will be your second home for research, studies, and even leisure. There is just one task to accomplish before you officially embark on your academic journey—a scavenger hunt!"
```

A small parchment materializes in front of the characters. It presents a list of clues.

```ad-quote
"The rules are simple," the voice says. "Each clue on this list will lead you to a different location in [[the Biblioplex]]. Simply travel to the area each clue references and perform the action the clue suggests. Time is of the essence. You have only until the end of the day to finish your hunt.

"Solve as many clues as you can, because at each location, you may win a prize! Now then, off you go!"
```

## Scavenger Hunt Clues
A character can win a prize for each clue they solve but can receive only one item in each place. If a character tries to redo a clue to receive a second item, the magic that reveals the item doesn't work again. 

Each clue can be unraveled either by deduction, or with a successful DC 10 Intelligence (Investigation) check. A decoded clue points the characters toward one of the areas of [[The Biblioplex]] as well as the action they must take to receive a prize in that area.

Here are the clues:
### Clue 1
You'll forget all about any trouble or plight when you step forward and are ensnarled in light.

```ad-tip 
title: Hall of Oracles 
collapse: closed

This clue refers the characters to the room they start the orientation in.

If a character touches the pooled energy below the snarl, they momentarily lose track of their body, overwhelmed by the snarl's magical power. The character automatically disengages from the snarl and discovers that they are holding a potion of healing.
```
### Clue 2
Alumni commission works when they retire, seeking promising mages to inspire.

```ad-tip
title: Student and Alumni Art Gallery
collapse: closed

This clue refers to the Student and Alumni Art Gallery.

When the characters wander through the gallery, they see a portrait of several older alumni wearing Prismari College robes. If a character examines the portrait, they find a plaque that reads: "At Strixhaven we were all inspired." Below the plaque is a small lever. If a character uses an action to pull the lever, a box pops out of the wall containing a Strixhaven pennant for each character in the party. Once it dispenses the pennants, the box disappears back into the wall and doesn't work for the characters again.
```
### Clue 3
Each group deserves a free treat for their investment. Serve up this list and enjoy your refreshment.

```ad-tip
title: Biblioplex Café 
collapse: closed

This clue refers to the Biblioplex Café

When the characters enter the café, they see several students enjoying drinks and snacks. Aisla Fitzbottom (chaotic good gnome commoner), the café manager, is a Strixhaven staff member and the only worker behind the counter at present. The characters must present their scavenger hunt list to Aisla. When they do, she tells them to come behind the counter and help her quickly restock the café's sandwiches and baked goods from several modified Heward's handy haversacks.

If a character goes above and beyond in their assistance with a successful DC 15 Dexterity check, Aisla gives that character a random trinket (roll on [this list](https://5e.tools/book.html#scc,2,trinkets,0)). Many students have ignored her requests for help during the orientation, she says, so she decides to make an exception with a gift from her own pockets. Plus, she likes the new students' ambition.
```
### Clue 4
These leafy beds aren't always what they seem. Give them a pat and see what you glean.

```ad-tip
title: Book Garden
collapse: closed

This clue refers to the book gardens.

When the characters enter a book garden, they see a lush arboretum. A successful DC 10 Intelligence (Investigation) check reveals that three of the shrubs are not ordinary greenery, but are instead [awakened shrubs](https://5e.tools/bestiary.html#awakened%20shrub_mm), each with a glistening crown of leaves. If a character uses an action to pat the shrubs on these leaves, the branches part to reveal a [cuddly Strixhaven mascot](https://5e.tools/items.html#cuddly%20strixhaven%20mascot_scc), representing a random mascot. This magic works only once per character.

```
### Clue 5
Some stars are ancient, enduring, and bright. But others—maybe you!—are born on opening night.

```ad-tip
title: Amphitheater
collapse: closed

This clue refers to the amphitheater.

When the characters reach the amphitheater, they see an impressively lavish stage, with the curtains drawn back as if to reveal performers on the opening night of a major production. If a character recites, sings, hums, belches, or otherwise emits any line or tune while standing on the stage, bright floodlights snap on around the stage's perimeter—a number of lights equal to the number of characters in the group. Approaching any of the lights reveals a recess in which lies a [hooded lantern](https://5e.tools/items.html#hooded%20lantern_phb) filled with oil.
```

## That Trunk Has Teeth!
Once the characters have completed as much of the scavenger hunt as they wish, they hear a commotion coming from the west shelves of the main stacks in area B10. Read or paraphrase the following:

```ad-quote
The joyous and energetic atmosphere of the first floor is shattered by panicked shouting.

"That trunk!" a young elf screams, pointing toward the stacks as she runs by. "That trunk has teeth! Please, someone, stop it!"

Chaos erupts in the library as students stream in all directions, their books and papers flying as they shout in fear. The only faculty mages in sight are trying to deal with panicked students. You can't just let some monster ruin the first day of classes. The words of Professor Tullus echo in your mind
```

The LARP guild were setting up for a show when one of their costume trunks was somehow transformed into a [[mimic]] (temporarily) as a result it is weaker than the regular [[mimic]] stat block.

**It has disadvantage on attack rolls.**
**Once it's defeated, the mimic turns back into an ordinary trunk.**

    damage_bonus: 3
```

### Ending the Threat
If all the characters fall [unconscious](https://5e.tools/conditionsdiseases.html#unconscious_phb) during the fight, Professor Mavinda Sharpbeak (neutral good owlin [[Silverquill professor of radiance]]; see [chapter 7](https://5e.tools/book.html#scc,8,silverquill%20professor%20of%20radiance,0)) arrives on the scene at the start of the next round and finishes off the mimic. If the characters defeat the mimic, Professor Sharpbeak arrives on the scene shortly after the group dispatches it. She carries a bag of [potions of healing](https://5e.tools/items.html#potion%20of%20healing_dmg), which she administers to any injured or [unconscious](https://5e.tools/conditionsdiseases.html#unconscious_phb) characters.

A guidance counsellor at Strixhaven, Professor Sharpbeak was overseeing the orientation activities, but the mass of fleeing students prevented her from responding to the incident immediately. When she has assisted any wounded characters, she introduces herself.

```ad-quote
"Students, well done!" Professor Sharpbeak exclaims, ruffling her feathers with pride. "Such bravery in this incoming class! And what a bizarre occurrence. I can't remember any of those old costume trunks ever bearing a hint of magic—let alone that manner of transmutation. I will be having a word with the equipment managers over at the Rose Stage. They're supposed to keep this sort of thing from happening!"
```

If the characters chat with the professor, she reassures them that this was an unfortunate incident—but sadly, not an unheard-of one, since strange monsters often find their way onto campus. Still, it's nothing to worry about. Before she goes, she reaches into her bag and gives each character 1 platinum piece, thanking them again for their help and welcoming them to campus.  

### Examining the Trunk
Characters who examine the mimic and succeed on a DC 12 Wisdom (Perception) check notice that the defeated trunk's wood and leather has been rubbed with a black, oily substance. If asked about this, Professor Sharpbeak says it's likely just a leather conditioner. With no magic remaining in the eldritch balm to reveal the contamination, she has no explanation for why the trunk temporarily turned into a mimic and attacked.

# Campus Life
To give the party some freedom to explore and take part in campus life, give them some space here to discuss what they get up to over the next few weeks, noting that this is the time in their college careers where classes are easy, just starting out, and the entire campus is abuzz with social life before we get deeper into the school year and study takes over, it's the back end of summer and the heat has hung around, every day the grounds are full of gatherings of students across the various lawns; and in the evenings the students hit up the inns and taverns on and around campus as they catch up after a long summer apart.

Finish this section off with some description of the contents of the classes that they are taking, to give them some idea that school *is* actually happening here, and that their characters are spending some time studying, completing assignments and passing their classes.

- [ ] Come up with a more practical class to run some RP in, preferably one shared by all the students in the party. Will need one shared class per semester, as they all take different clas

# Frog's the Word
Let the party go about what they wish to. Make it known a couple of weeks have passed and they are settling in comfortably.

```ad-quote
Murmurs of excited curiosity ripple through the clusters of students around you, and {another student} suddenly barrels toward you, laughing uproariously.

Seeing no faculty nearby, the student beckons to the characters.

"You've all got to see this!" the student chortles. "We found these weird frogs and snuck them into the Fireside Lounge at Firejolt Café, and now we're going to race the little hoppers! Quick! Come see before the professors find out!"
```

In the cafe after describing:

```ad-quote
The air buzzes with excitement—and the smell of coffee—as you make your way toward the back of Firejolt Café and duck into the lounge to witness the scene.

Hidden from the view of the barista station, the lounge's central table has been pushed toward the wall and its chairs haphazardly tossed out of the way. In the middle of the room hop four unusual frogs. Each is glowing in vibrant colors—red, blue, violet, and orange—and has been outfitted with a tiny costume. One wears a makeshift cape, another has suspenders, a third wears a stylish bow tie, and the fourth has a top hat perched jauntily on its head.

Someone has used chalk to mark lanes on the floor, and multiple students are trying to corral the frogs into a starting position.
```

A student notices the characters and shouts, "You're just in time! Want to race these frogs with us?"

The amphibians in the lounge are four [frogs](https://5e.tools/bestiary.html#frog_mm) that students found outside the café and smuggled inside. The frogs' glowing colours appear to be the result of some magic the students haven't been able to source. The costumes—and the frog race that is afoot!—were the students' ideas. For the race, a single student will "coach" each frog toward the finish. The winning coach will receive bragging rights—as well as a purse of donations from the crowd that totals 30 gp.

## Participating in the Race

Play the horse racing card game. Deal out the side cards that set teams back before any changes have been made to the deck. Once the below options are resolved, re-shuffle the remaining cards and race!

- Race a Frog. A character might coach one of the frogs, encouraging it toward the finish line with words, gestures, and other antics. The character can urge their frog to victory with a successful DC 12 Wisdom (Animal Handling) check, this will remove a card from each other team's pool. Encourage a player to really sell this scene by naming their frog and coming up with ways to inspire it. 

- Heckle a Coach. A character might taunt one of the coaches. If the heckled coach is another player character, that character has disadvantage on their Wisdom (Animal Handling) check to coach the frog. If the NPC fails their animal handling roll, they also lose an additional card from their deck.

If the player team win they get the 30gp prize pool to split.

### They've Gone Berserk!

After the race ends, the four frogs start belching strangely, and their eyes turn red. As the characters and the other students look on, the frogs suddenly grow into four [giant frogs](https://5e.tools/bestiary.html#giant%20frog_mm), shredding their makeshift costumes and furiously lashing out at the crowd!

```statblock

    desc: "Melee Weapon Attack: +3 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 4 (1d6 + 1) piercing damage, and the target is grappled (escape DC 11). Until this grapple ends, the target is restrained, and the frog can't bite another target."
    attack_bonus: 3
    damage_dice: 1d6
    damage_bonus: 1
  - name: Swallow
    desc: The frog makes one bite attack against a Small or smaller target it is grappling. If the attack hits, the target is swallowed, and the grapple ends. The swallowed target is blinded and restrained, it has total cover against attacks and other effects outside the frog, and it takes 5 (2d4) acid damage at the start of each of the frog's turns. The frog can have only one target swallowed at a time. If the frog dies, a swallowed creature is no longer restrained by it and can escape from the corpse using 5 ft. of movement, exiting prone.
    attack_bonus: 0

```

The other students scatter, and it's up to the characters to subdue the giant frogs. Luckily for any character who has grown attached to a frog, any frog reduced to 0 hit points becomes docile, and its eyes return to normal. Alternatively, a character can use an action to coax a frog into shaking off the malady affecting it with a DC 15 Wisdom (Animal Handling) check. On a success, a frog becomes docile again and stops attacking. After 1 minute, each docile frog reverts back to normal size and appearance.

### Ending the Threat
If all the characters fall [unconscious](https://5e.tools/conditionsdiseases.html#unconscious_phb), café manager Ellina Tanglewood (chaotic good elf [mage](https://5e.tools/bestiary.html#mage_mm)) rushes onto the scene and subdues the frogs. She has two [potions of healing](https://5e.tools/items.html#potion%20of%20healing_dmg) behind the barista station and can administer them as needed if anyone gets hurt.

### Examining the Frogs
Once the frogs are no longer threats, a successful DC 12 Wisdom (Perception) check reveals that the frogs belched out a strange, black oily substance just before they grew in size and attacked. It appears to be the same substance found on the trunk during orientation; indeed, [[Murgaxor]] coaxed the frogs to ingest some of the corrupted eldritch balm to cause their transformation. Any character who notices the oily substance also can tell that it smells slightly sweet, which likely encouraged the frogs to ingest it.
