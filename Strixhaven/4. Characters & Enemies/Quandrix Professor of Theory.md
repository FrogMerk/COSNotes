Professors of theory advance the Quandrix philosophy that math-magical manipulation is most powerful in the abstract dimension of minds, probability, and the fabric of magic itself. Their equations shift perceptions in profound ways, alter probability, and interfere with the formation of other magic. In battle, the professors tweak probability to impede attacks and strike at the minds of their foes with lancing equations that disrupt the opponent's resolve.

Professors of theory hold that altering the way a person interacts with the world can change the world. They impress upon their students to use magic as a tool to shape the overall experience of reality, and in turn make the world a better place.
## Quandrix Scholars
The scholars of Quandrix College focus on the mathematical principles that govern reality. Through these formulas, they can manipulate properties of matter and space, as well as abstract and conceptual space such as the mind, probability, and the flow of magic itself.
