To enhance their studies of the past, Lorehold students often call upon the spirits of dead creatures. Mages seeking longer-term assistance from ancient spirits have learned to house these spirits in statues, giving them a more permanent residence from which to assist the living.

Some of these spirit statues bond with and mentor a specific mage, but most serve in a variety of roles for numerous individuals, ranging from research colleagues to martial tacticians. Regardless, their appearance is so common around the [[Lorehold Campus]] that they have become the college's [[Mascots]].
