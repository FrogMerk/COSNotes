Professors of growth nurture the essence of nature through their magic. They brew infusions of plants, fungi, and insects or other minuscule creatures that thrum with the essence of life, using these infusions to fuel their magic instead of using traditional material components. In battle, they flood their allies with vital essence, healing wounds and soothing ailments. Their foes face the wrath of nature itself, from grasping plants and conjured poisonous vines to avatars of nature's wrath.

These professors teach their students to focus on the growth side of the natural cycle of life and death and to avoid wasting resources. They espouse the philosophy that a thriving system benefits all.
