At the edge of Archway Commons and just outside [[The Biblioplex]] stands the cozy Firejolt Café, where students cram both information and caffeine into themselves before exams. The café's name comes from its trademark beverage, which the manager, an elf mage named Ellina, brews with her fire magic. The Firejolt has a reputation as a hangout for first-year students, but older students from all five colleges can be seen inside at all hours.

Firejolt Café is the most popular place at Strixhaven to grab tea or coffee, chat with friends, or study among the hustle and bustle of a typical day on campus. The café's interior is clean and well lit, and its walls are decorated with fun, cartoonish scenes animated by permanent illusion magic. Well-known scenes include a jovial frog in a wizard's hat stirring a cauldron, a dancing trio of lightning bolts with grinning faces, and a raven wearing a cravat and sipping daintily from a cup of coffee held in one wing.

## Firejolt Café Features
The café has the following features:

- **Ceilings.** The café's ceilings are 20 feet high.

- **Doors.** At night, the exterior doors to the café are closed, locked, and sealed with an [arcane lock](https://5e.tools/spells.html#arcane%20lock_phb) spell. A successful DC 25 Dexterity check using thieves' tools opens the lock (DC 35 while the [arcane lock](https://5e.tools/spells.html#arcane%20lock_phb) is in effect). Only certain faculty members and Ellina Tanglewood, the café's manager (see [area F3](https://5e.tools/adventure.html#scc-ck,0,f3.%20barista%20station,0)), know the [arcane lock](https://5e.tools/spells.html#arcane%20lock_phb)'s password.

- **Magic Steps.** The steps marking the edge of each tier of the study area are enchanted to move and reshape themselves for full accessibility. See the "[Strixhaven Accessibility](https://5e.tools/adventure.html#scc-ck,0,strixhaven%20accessibility,0)" sidebar.

- **Students.** Students of all years and colleges can be found in Firejolt Café. See [chapter 7](https://5e.tools/book.html#scc,8) for stat blocks for [first-year students](https://5e.tools/bestiary.html#first-year%20student_scc), and for apprentices and pledgemages from the different colleges.

## Firejolt Café Locations
### F1. Study Tables
These long benches sit atop two raised tiers with magic steps between them, affording easy access to the seating area below. Some thirty students are typically here during the day, studying quietly.

### F2. Seating Area
This area is usually more crowded than the café's study tables. At least fifty students sit sociably in groups, chatting and having tea and coffee. The open spaces in the north part of this area are typically filled with students waiting to join the queue at the barista station or scouting for a good place to sit.

### F3. Barista Station
This bustling service counter is the demesne of Ellina Tanglewood (chaotic good elf [mage](https://5e.tools/bestiary.html#mage_mm)), the Strixhaven employee who manages the café and serves as its chief barista. Ellina typically works alongside five older student employees, one from each college, though she sometimes hires younger students who express interest in working for her (see the "[Jobs](https://5e.tools/book.html#scc,3,jobs,0)" section earlier in the chapter).

The front counter of the barista station is a whirl of chaos while Ellina and the other employees deal with the orders of dozens of students and faculty members. The back of the station is calmer, and includes a small break area for employees as well as shelves for personal belongings and café supplies.

The café strictly sells coffee and tea, but Ellina and the other talented baristas can make nearly any form of those drinks on request. A relatively common coffee or tea costs 1 cp, while a more complicated order might cost 2 cp. The café's signature Firejolt latte costs 10 gp; it confers resistance to fire for 1 minute after drinking it, and it can be brewed only by Ellina using her fire magic.

A menu is made available for the players:

### F4. Newsstand
This small store inside Firejolt Café sells magazines, knickknacks, posters, stickers, and other decorative and leisure items. The subjects of the magazines are all magic themed, with titles ranging from _Mages Monthly_ to _Potions! Potions! Potions_! to _Spells and Caster_. Staff members at the barista station take turns working the newsstand, which sometimes closes when the café is particularly busy. Most items here cost 1 cp, though higher-end items might be available at your discretion.

### F5. Fireside Lounge
Much more comfortable than the café's other seating areas, this lounge is filled with sofas and armchairs where students can relax away from the hubbub. Fireplaces in the northern corners are lit by [continual flame](https://5e.tools/spells.html#continual%20flame_phb) spells. Some twenty students are typically found here, using the tables to study quietly.

### F6. Quiet Room
As with the fireside lounge, these rooms are quieter than the café's main seating areas. However, with large tables and more functional chairs, they're more oriented toward studying and completing classwork. Up to ten students are typically found in each of these rooms, engaged in quiet study.
