At the edge of Archway Commons and just outside [[The Biblioplex]] stands the cozy Firejolt Café, where students cram both information and caffeine into themselves before exams. The café's name comes from its trademark beverage, which the manager, an elf mage named Ellina, brews with her fire magic. The Firejolt has a reputation as a hangout for first-year students, but older students from all five colleges can be seen inside at all hours.

Firejolt Café is the most popular place at Strixhaven to grab tea or coffee, chat with friends, or study among the hustle and bustle of a typical day on campus. The café's interior is clean and well lit, and its walls are decorated with fun, cartoonish scenes animated by permanent illusion magic. Well-known scenes include a jovial frog in a wizard's hat stirring a cauldron, a dancing trio of lightning bolts with grinning faces, and a raven wearing a cravat and sipping daintily from a cup of coffee held in one wing.

## Firejolt Café Features
The café has the following features:

- **Ceilings.** The café's ceilings are 20 feet high.

- **Doors.** At night, the exterior doors to the café are closed, locked, and sealed with an [arcane lock](https://5e.tools/spells.html#arcane%20lock_phb) spell. A successful DC 25 Dexterity check using thieves' tools opens the lock (DC 35 while the [arcane lock](https://5e.tools/spells.html#arcane%20lock_phb) is in effect). Only certain faculty members and Ellina Tanglewood, the café's manager (see [area F3](https://5e.tools/adventure.html#scc-ck,0,f3.%20barista%20station,0)), know the [arcane lock](https://5e.tools/spells.html#arcane%20lock_phb)'s password.

- **Magic Steps.** The steps marking the edge of each tier of the study area are enchanted to move and reshape themselves for full accessibility. See the "[Strixhaven Accessibility](https://5e.tools/adventure.html#scc-ck,0,strixhaven%20accessibility,0)" sidebar.

- **Students.** Students of all years and colleges can be found in Firejolt Café. See [chapter 7](https://5e.tools/book.html#scc,8) for stat blocks for [first-year students](https://5e.tools/bestiary.html#first-year%20student_scc), and for apprentices and pledgemages from the different colleges.
