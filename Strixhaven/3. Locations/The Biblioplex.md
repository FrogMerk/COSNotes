**The Biblioplex** is the crown jewel of Strixhaven University, a vast, awe-inspiring library where magic and intellect entwine in endless pursuit of truth. Towering marble archways are etched with glowing runes and trimmed with gilded ivy, and stretch high into vaulted ceilings that shimmer faintly with starlight, regardless of the hour. 

The air hums with energy. Sparks of wild, uncontained magic dance across the fingertips of students practicing cantrips between study sessions, while scholarly debates erupt over obscure theories of spellcraft, punctuated by flashes of light and laughter.

Despite its grandeur, the Biblioplex never feels cold or impersonal. There's a warmth that radiates from the pursuit of knowledge itself — a palpable, infectious drive shared by hundreds of young minds from every corner of Arcavios and beyond. Every hallway, every hidden study nook, every whispering alcove feels like it holds a secret waiting to be discovered.

Above it all, the Dawnbow hovers — silent, luminous, ever-present — casting shifting light through the stained-glass oculi in the ceiling, bathing the interior in ethereal hues as if the very sky is reading along.

To walk into the Biblioplex is to step into a living spell — a place where curiosity bends reality, and where learning is not just revered, but alive.

The center of Strixhaven is the Biblioplex, the university's main library. At the heart of the library is a snarl, a tangle in the fabric of magic, that glows like a miniature sun in the grand Hall of Oracles. A star arch called [[The Dawnbow]] curves across the sky above the library, marking its location as a center of mystic learning.

Arches welcome inquisitive minds into the library. Inside, almost every surface from the floor to the high ceiling is jammed with stacks of books. The interior of the Biblioplex is vast, with long hallways, archive chambers tall enough to have their own weather, and even pools and moat-passages crossable only by boat.

Five lines of beacon-towers radiate from the Biblioplex like enormous spokes. These Torches of Enlightenment stretch out to the five college campuses and beyond, more than a hundred miles into the surrounding countryside. They burn perpetually with magical flame, symbolising the path toward learning and an escape from ignorance.

The Biblioplex library acts as a hub for learning and gathering for students across Strixhaven. Before the characters begin the "Orientation Challenge" event, they might wish to explore the library. The map below is the DM version, for the player version, provide the [[Biblioplex Map]] in the handouts folder.

## Biblioplex Locations
The following locations are keyed to map 3.1. All descriptions assume the characters are wandering the Biblioplex during the day. At night, the library is locked and devoid of other students or staff.

### B1. Main Entrance
Enchanted marble steps lead up 5 feet to a small plaza at the Biblioplex's entrance. The double door's vertical handles are each carved in the likeness of a robed scholar. During the day, the doors stand open. At night, the doors are closed, locked, and sealed with an arcane lock spell. A successful DC 25 Dexterity check using thieves' tools opens the lock (DC 35 while the arcane lock is in effect). Only the Biblioplex's reference librarians and certain faculty members know the arcane lock's password.
### B2. Biblioplex Lounge
Luxurious couches and sturdy tables furnish this spacious area. Students, employees, and staff members often use this lounge to relax between shifts in the [[Student Store]] (area B5), the Biblioplex café (area B6), or elsewhere in the library. Each table holds piles of magazines, newsletters, flyers, and nonmagical scrolls from around campus. A character who examines these materials finds recruitment flyers from 1d3 Extracurriculars. They also find "Help Wanted" ads for the Jobs at the Biblioplex. Extracurriculars and Jobs are detailed earlier in the chapter.
### B3. Student Café Seating
This area typically holds 21 (6d6) students, all of them studying, eating, chatting, or even sleeping. Many enjoy food and drinks from the café (area B6).
### B4. Information Desk
Three faculty-appointed reference librarians work at each of these circular desks (use any of the professor stat blocks found in chapter 7 if needed). All are expert scholars and powerful mages. They can provide helpful instructions for where to find any public location or collection in the Biblioplex.
### B5. [[Student Store]]
This small shop is stocked with books, equipment, and gear useful as academic supplies. The store's manager is Groff Lundquist (neutral good human commoner), a friendly Strixhaven staff member known for his ability to fashionably mix and match items of university apparel. Students can buy hats, scarves, tunics, robes, gloves, and other apparel embroidered with the Strixhaven star or with the sigil of any of Strixhaven's colleges. Costs range from 5 cp to 5 gp or more, at your discretion.

Once a character chooses a college at the start of second year, they receive a set of college robes, a knit hat, a scarf, a tunic, and gloves free of charge. (This set normally costs 5 gp.)

In addition to nonmagical gear and clothing, the [[Student Store]] also contains the magic items from the "Magic Items" section of chapter 2.
### B6. Biblioplex Café
One wall of this area is covered with a mural made from a living tree's roots, which move occasionally and make the entire place feel alive. The ceiling is covered in painted leaves, which change colors depending on the season thanks to a permanent illusion effect. The magic also prompts painted squirrels to run up and down the mural's roots, and painted birds to chirp among the leaves.

Up to ten students are typically present here during the day. Ordinarily, three more students work here, but during orientation, the café's manager, Aisla Fitzbottom (chaotic good gnome commoner), is working alone. She is charmingly perky and has a mind like a steel trap when it comes to recognizing students. However, her organizational skills are somewhat lackadaisical.

The café always serves coffee and tea, which costs 1 cp per cup. The sandwich of the day varies. Roll below to determine which sandwich is available on any given day in the café.

| 5   | Rainbow carrots and watercress chestnuts on white |
| 6   | Dragonbreath peppers and salami on a bagel        |
### B7. Lecture Hall
Each of these halls hosts interdisciplinary lectures for Strixhaven students. The seats magically grow or shrink to comfortably accommodate students of any size or body type. The halls' acoustics are magically enhanced to amplify the professor's lecture and minimize the disruption of side conversations. While a class is in session, each hall holds a professor and up to thirty students.
### B8. Study Area
These open study areas feature simple wooden tables and chairs. During the day, up to thirty students can typically be found here.

If the characters pass by the western study area before orientation, members of the Live-Action Roleplaying Guild are pulling costumes and props from a half dozen old trunks. The guild is preparing for an event later on the Biblioplex's lawn: a game they call Beholders versus Behirs. Rosie Wuzfeddlims (chaotic good gnome [[First-Year Student]]; see the "Fellow Students" section) is directing students as they cobble together beholder and behir costumes, as well as visual effects made from sheets, blankets, wooden frames, tin plates, and illusion magic. (This preparation erupts into chaos during "That Trunk Has Teeth!" later in this chapter.)
### B9. Book Garden
In these quiet areas, students sit on the grass and study among lush foliage. Sometime last year, three awakened shrubs wandered in here and settled in each garden, and the university has welcomed them to stay. Members of Witherbloom College typically tend this space, and three Witherbloom pledgemages (see chapter 7) can be found here most days.

Members of the Fantastical Horticulture Club often relax in this area and hold meetings here from time to time. If the characters explore this area before or after orientation, Urzmaktok Grojsh (neutral orc Witherbloom apprentice; see the "Fellow Students" section) is here, recruiting first-year students to the club. 
### B10. Main Stacks
Floor-to-ceiling bookshelves fill the center and the east end of the library's first floor, with the denser east stacks under a magic effect that shifts them when students approach, creating space to stand single-file between them. These books are mostly introductory texts, and first-year students are often directed here by their instructors. In each of these areas, two [[Cogwork Archivists]] (see chapter 7) busily shelve returned or misfiled books.

Characters who browse these shelves unaided stumble on what they need with a successful DC 15 Wisdom (Perception) check. However, it's always easier to ask a reference librarian (area B4).
### B11. Hall of Oracles
This hallowed hall is filled with statues of the university's past Oracles. At the center of the hall, a pulsing ball of magical energy—the Strixhaven Snarl—fills the area with bright light. See [[Snarls and Star Arches]] for information about snarls and [[Archaics and the Oracle]].

The "Orientation Challenge" event starts here.

![[hall of oracles.png]]
### B12. Student and Alumni Art Gallery
This crisp-looking room features white walls and columns that stretch from floor to ceiling. Displayed on or within these are art pieces representative of various media. Students from Prismari College typically tend this space, and three Prismari pledgemages (see chapter 7) can be found here most days, either cleaning the gallery or studying the techniques used in the displayed pieces. A storage area at the back holds supplies and artwork waiting to go on display.

The Distinguished Society of Fine Artists often meets and holds discussions here. If the characters explore this area before or after orientation, Cadoras Damellawar (chaotic good elf [[First-Year Student]]; see the "Fellow Students" section) is here recruiting first-year students to the society.
### B13. Amphitheater
This impressive stage is used for lectures, for assemblies, and as a gathering place in case of emergencies. Magic steps lead up to the stage from the floor of the library. Members of the Playactors Drama Guild often use this stage to meet and rehearse when the Rose Stage on Silverquill's campus is unavailable. If the characters pass by this area before or after orientation, Quentillius Antiphiun Melentor III (neutral human [[First-Year Student]]; see the "Fellow Students" section) is here recruiting new students to the Playactors Drama Guild.

### B14. Student Activities Center
This room is filled with tables and chairs and is available to any student organization registered with Strixhaven for use as a meeting place, rehearsal facility, or crafting site, or for other approved purposes.

If the characters explore this area before or after orientation, it is set up to promote Extracurriculars, the rules of which appear earlier in the chapter. The tables are covered with flyers from the Dead Languages Society, the Dragonchess Club, the Dragonsguard Historical Society, Future Entrepreneurs of Strixhaven, the Intramural Gymnastics Club, the Intramural Silkball Club, the Intramural Water-Dancing Club, the Mage Tower Cheer Squad, the Strixhaven Iron-Lifters Society, the Strixhaven Show Band Association, the Strixhaven Star, and Student-Mages of Faith, and are staffed by the students listed in "Extracurriculars" as being associated with them.

Extracurricular groups not here can be found elsewhere in the Biblioplex, along with their student NPCs—the Live-Action Roleplaying Guild (area B8), the Fantastical Horticulture Club (area B9), the Distinguished Society of Fine Artists (area B12), and the Playactors Drama Guild (area B13).
### B15. Student Council Hall
Filled with wooden tables and benches, this room has a flag displaying the Strixhaven star symbol hanging on its back wall. Here, a student council publicly debates Strixhaven policies that most affect the student body. The leaders of the school's Extracurriculars come to the council to conduct matters of business, and the council usually meets on the first day of every month. Outside those meeting days, the room is used for other official university business or stands empty.
### B16. Advanced Student Stacks
Rooms on the Biblioplex's second floor can be accessed only with keys held by faculty members, or that the reference librarians in area B4 grant students on a case-by-case basis. Typically, students don't receive keys to these stacks until they're studying for their final thesis during their fourth year at Strixhaven. The arcane knowledge in the books here is not public—and is sometimes dangerous.

To prevent overly ambitious mages and Strixhaven's enemies from teleporting into and accessing this area, two shield guardians patrol at all times. Both the guardians have sleep as their stored spell, and their control amulets are in the possession of two of the librarians on duty in the Biblioplex. Students with permission to work here are given passwords by which the Constructs recognize them as friends.
### B17. Advanced Student Office
These private offices are for students working on their theses, accessed using the same keys that allow access to area B16.
### B18. Advanced Student Lounge
This rest area is designed to help stressed-out senior students unwind. Large tables are set up for gaming and shelves are filled with recreational reading material. The area can be accessed only through the advanced student stacks (area B17).
### B19. The Compendium
This area on the library's third floor holds copies of most of the mundane, widely available written works in the multiverse. The books are inscrutably cataloged, so it's almost impossible to find anything without requesting information from a reference librarian (area B4). Characters who look for information without obtaining help discover what they're looking for only with a successful DC 20 Wisdom (Perception) check.

At the center of this area stands a statue depicting a mighty, benevolent dragon. The magical statue reads aloud the contents of most books placed in front of it if a character makes that request verbally or mentally. (The magic of the statue can assess text such as verbal curses that present a danger if read aloud, and the statue ignores requests to read such text.)
