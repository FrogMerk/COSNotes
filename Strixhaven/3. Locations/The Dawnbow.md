**The Dawnbow** is a breathtaking arc of floating, opalescent-veined stones that hang frozen in midair above [[the Biblioplex]] - the beating heart of Strixhaven’s magical knowledge. Its stones glow vibrantly with shifting hues, refracting the ambient magic of the planes. Students often gather to watch the light of the setting sun dance across the Dawnbow, said to be one of the most beautiful sights in all of Arcavios.

Students and scholars alike look to it for inspiration, tradition, and sometimes, omens. Some say it was formed at the founding of Strixhaven by the first convergence of the five colleges’ magic, others claim it predates even the dragons themselves. Regardless of its origin, the Dawnbow is a radiant sigil in the skies of Arcavios — a symbol of limitless possibility and the pursuit of knowledge without end.
