**To the Esteemed [Student's Name],**

It is with great honor and arcane delight that we inform you of your **acceptance into Strixhaven University**, the premier institution for magical learning across the planes.

Your application has been reviewed by the Conclave of Deans, and your unique talents, intellectual vigor, and potential for the arcane arts have earned you a coveted place among our incoming students. Whether your path leads you through the vibrant halls of Prismari, the ancient libraries of Lorehold, the tangled debates of Quandrix, the secretive studies of Witherbloom, or the cunning corridors of Silverquill, **your journey begins now**.

You are formally invited to attend **Orientation Day**, which will commence at noon on the **first day of Emberfall**, beneath the ancient arches of thewnbow.
There, you will meet fellow initiates, be sorted into your college, receive your spellcasting materials, and take your first step into a life of magical mastery.

Prepare yourself for trials of wit, weavings of power, and friendships forged in starlight and spellfire. Strixhaven is more than a school — it is a crucible where destiny is written in flame, ink, and ambition.

Should you accept (as we sincerely hope you shall), kindly present this letter at the Astral Gate upon arrival. A representative will guide you to the Hall of Welcome.

**Congratulations, and may your mind ever seek the unknown.**

Arcana et Veritas,
