Each of Strixhaven's five colleges has a mascotâ€”a small creature associated with the magic of the school and often found wandering their respective campuses. Witherbloom's mascots, pests, are naturally found in the world around the campus. The other colleges' mascots are brought into being through magic. The Strixhaven Mascots table lists the mascots by college.

| College     | Mascot                   |
| ----------- | ------------------------ |
| Lorehold    | [[Spirit Statue Mascot]] |
| Prismari    | [[Art Elemental Mascot]] |
| Quandrix    | [[Fractal Mascot]]       |
| Silverquill | [[Inkling Mascot]]       |
| Witherbloom | [[Pest Mascot]]          |

The five kinds of mascots act as companions for students and faculty, sometimes serving as willing subjects for experiments or demonstrations, and occasionally even helping out in a duel or a more serious combat situation. Most notably, mascots are also playing pieces of sorts in the Strixhaven sport of Mage Tower
