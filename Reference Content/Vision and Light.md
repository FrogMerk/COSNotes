The most fundamental tasks of adventuring— noticing danger, finding hidden objects, hitting an enemy in combat, and targeting a spell, to name just a few—rely heavily on a character’s ability to see.  
  
Darkness and other effects that obscure vision can prove a significant hindrance.  
A given area might be lightly or heavily obscured. In a **lightly obscured** area, such as dim light, patchy fog, or moderate foliage, creatures have disadvantage on [Wisdom (Perception) checks](https://roll20.net/compendium/dnd5e/Rules:Ability%20Scores?expansion=0#toc_30) that rely on sight.  
  
A **heavily obscured** area—such as darkness, opaque fog, or dense foliage—blocks vision entirely. A creature effectively suffers from the [blinded](https://roll20.net/compendium/dnd5e/Rules:Conditions?expansion=0#toc_1) condition (see [Conditions](https://roll20.net/compendium/dnd5e/Rules:Conditions?expansion=0#content) ) when trying to see something in that area.  
  
The presence or absence of light in an environment creates three categories of illumination: bright light, dim light, and darkness.  
  
**Bright light** lets most creatures see normally. Even gloomy days provide bright light, as do [torches](https://roll20.net/compendium/dnd5e/Items:Torch?expansion=0#content), lanterns, fires, and other sources of illumination within a specific radius.  
  
**Dim light**, also called shadows, creates a lightly obscured area. An area of dim light is usually a boundary between a source of bright light, such as a torch, and surrounding darkness. The soft light of twilight and dawn also counts as dim light. A particularly brilliant full moon might bathe the land in dim light.  
  
**Darkness** creates a heavily obscured area. Characters face darkness outdoors at night (even most moonlit nights), within the confines of an unlit dungeon or a subterranean vault, or in an area of magical darkness.
